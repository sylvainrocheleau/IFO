{u'full_article': u'<p>Gas station attendants, servers in restaurants or others forced to pay when customers take off without paying are getting a clear message that it shouldn\'t happen.</p><p>The Wall government is putting out a statement in response to stories of workers forced to pay for customer theft.\xa0 It reminds employers that\'s illegal.</p><p>Last month, News Talk Radio brought you stories of gas station attendants who said they were forced to make up for drivers who drove away without paying. One gas station attendant in Regina we spoke to says this is a common situation in her experience. Recently, a driver using fake plates drove off without paying in a\xa0 \'gas and dash.\'\xa0 The woman only made $55 in wages that day, but owed her boss $99.84.</p><p>"If you do the mistake, you have to pay for the mistakes.\xa0 Of course it is not our mistake, but still." </p><p>Her boss\'s rule is that if an employee gets the licence plate of a gas thief, then they won\'t be held responsible. But in this case the driver had a fake plate.</p><p>"So then we have to pay, he said, \'No, it\'s your mistake.\' So you just write down the numbers and stuff like that," she explained.</p><p>The government statement says that aside from taxes, or things like union dues or benefit plans, anything else requires your consent. It states wages can\'t be deducted for broken equipment, cash register shortages, mandatory training, improper use of company equipment or actions taken by others. That includes someone leaving a restaurant or gas station without paying.</p><p>But, employers who do dock paycheques won\'t be required to tell employees about this.\xa0 The government says employers can put up a poster with the information, if they\'re so inclined.</p><p>And it encourages employees who feel they\'ve been hit with unfair deductions to contact Labour Standards at 1-800-667-1783.</p><p>With files from CJME\'s Natalie Geddes</p><p>\xa0</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://cjme.com/rss-feed/6183', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://cjme.com/article/181788/gas-and-dash-stories-prompt-warning-government', u'author': u'Murray Wood', u'original_article_url': u'http://cjme.com/article/181788/gas-and-dash-stories-prompt-warning-government', u'scraped_on': 1453823034, u'published_date': u'Wed, 03 Oct 12 15:09:41 -0600', u'title': u'"Gas and Dash" stories prompt warning from government', u'_id': ObjectId('56a7943b1d41c87ba5c98f0e'), u'media_url': u'http://cjme.com/'}
{u'full_article': u'<p class="section entrytext"/><p>Seriously, someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 who got worked up about a New York Post report by someone I\u2019ve never heard of simply has too much time on their hands or something like that.</p><p>The faux \u201cstory\u201d had some milquetoast quote from an anonymous source \u201cclose\u201d to DeMar DeRozan that said he\u2019ll opt out of his contract next summer to make about $20 million instead of about $10 million but then goes on to quote that same fictitious person as saying he/she/it doesn\u2019t know what DeRozan will do because DeRozan himself isn\u2019t sure?</p><p>Oh, and it adds that the Brooklyn Nets, one of the truly laughable NBA franchises with no redeeming future to speak of, would like to sign him so he can lose again for years and years?</p><p>I get that the Post is the Post (a guy intimately familiar with it once told me the sports philosophy was \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to be wrong big\u201d) but that\u2019s a ridiculous waste of printer\u2019s ink.</p><p>This will be a story in late June and July, folks. Right now it\u2019s folly and filler and not worthy of your concern or attention.</p><p>Still with DeRozan, sort of, there didn\u2019t seem to be too many surprises when the league announced the latest results of balloting for all-star starters yesterday, did there?</p><p>It\u2019s good, I think, that Lowry is catching up to Kyrie Irving because he\u2019s exponentially a better all-star starting candidate this year seeing that Irving\u2019s barely played;\xa0 I would suggest that if the Cavs guard doesn\u2019t start he doesn\u2019t make the team through the coaches.</p><p>That trickle down effect could very well land DeRozan \u2013 entirely deserving \u2013 into the game and I get that Dwyane Wade\u2019s popularity is what it is and he\u2019s having a pretty good year in Miami, I still think an all-Toronto backcourt is easily explained and supported.</p><p>Yes, the Heat have a good record \u2013 pretty much the same as Toronto\u2019s actually \u2013 and Wade\u2019s a big factor (I\u2019d say Bosh is more of one but that\u2019s just me) \u2013 but you could make a case DeRozan is having a better one.</p><p>The Kobe thing is what it is, can\u2019t imagine it changes over the last fortnight of balloting but it will be at least marginally interesting to see how the East backcourt shakes out not only through fans but ultimately through the coaches, who have to put the pieces of a worthy roster together.</p><p>So many great ones to pick on the guy\u2019s birthday but this is a personal fave among all of them.</p><p>Could really use more mail; bailed on Washington for some maintenance so there\u2019s a bit of time now in the day/evening to get it done. All the typing should be done at askdoug@thestar.ca and you\u2019ll be glad you did.</p><p>It\u2019s been a while but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed \u2013 ahem, @lauraarmy \u2013 that Tottenham\u2019s on a bit of a role and, as the smart ones say looked headed back to \u201cthe real Europe\u201d and when they get a result against Leicester mid-week at home, we\u2019re setting our sights directly on Arsenal.</p><p>But the weekend is given over now to FA Cup third round play and it speaks to one of the more fascinating things about British and European soccer these days and I\u2019m sure one of the reasons the game \u2013 particularly the EPL \u2013 have grown so greatly in popularity.</p><p>Remember back in the day \u2013 and you do have to be Of A Certain Vintage to recall \u2013 when about the only British soccer game we could see on television here was the FA Cup final?</p><p>No regular season games, no pre- or post-game chat shows and analysis, certainly no midweek games and it was even hard to find a Saturday morning saloon with like-minded fans to watch your favourite team play on some scratchy satellite feed that might go in and out a half dozen times a game.</p><p>Now? There are dozens of games from all over Europe available every weekend, the Champions League final is something close to a mini-Super Bowl that draws in all kinds of casual fans. It\u2019s pretty cool and I bet the reason a lot of people pay far closer attention to the sport now than they did.</p><p>Hey, the Rock start tomorrow \u2013 Toronto\u2019s most prolific championship contender of this era \u2013 and they seem to be living proof that a niche professional sport can sustain support over the years.</p><p>Super Son and I once took in a game \u2013 some nice gentleman gave us a couple of seats right on the glass as an upgrade to ours \u2013 and I will say this:</p><p>If you thought the music and palaver at a Raptors game was intrusive, the NBA is like a funeral home compared to a Rock game and I hope that\u2019s changed.</p><p>Okay, here\u2019s one I got yesterday from a long-time loyal Irregular Doug and it\u2019ll maybe give you a few minutes of entertainment trying to come up with the answers:</p><p>\u201cHere is a good trivia question when you are sitting with your buddies tilting back a few. Now that Griffey has been elected to the Hall Seattle will have a player in the HOF. There are 5 active teams that don\'t have a HOF representative, can you name them and no googling. And one of them has been a franchise for over 50 years. Cheers</p><p>Okay, here we go, with no googling, I promise:</p><p>Tampa and Miami, Washington, Colorado and the Angels?</p><p>I don\u2019t imagine I got it right just going through the teams in my mind but if you want to take a guess \u2013 NO GOOGLING! \u2013 and ship \u2018em off to the mailbag, I\u2019ll throw them up, with the right answers, tomorrow morning.</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.thestar.com/feeds.blogs.sports.doug_smiths_sports_blog.rss', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.thestar.com/sports/doug_smiths_sports_blog/2016/01/-news-about-derozan-is-the-start-of-months-of-tedium.html', u'author': u'Doug Smith - Sports Reporter', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.thestar.com/sports/doug_smiths_sports_blog/2016/01/-news-about-derozan-is-the-start-of-months-of-tedium.html', u'scraped_on': 1453823416, u'published_date': u'Fri, 8 Jan 2016 08:00:06 EST', u'title': u'"News" about DeRozan is the start of months of tedium', u'_id': ObjectId('56a795b91d41c87ba5c9adb5'), u'media_url': u'http://www.thestar.com/'}
