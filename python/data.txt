{u'full_article': u'<p>The Trudeau government\u2019s move to add new hurdles to the pipeline approval process will go down as either the brilliant counterintuitive thrust that creates social licence for languishing energy infrastructure projects or the fatal blow that condemns them to the scrap heap.</p><p>Such is the new government\u2019s desire to please everyone that it\u2019s impossible to tell whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is more committed to improving market access for Alberta\u2019s oil or to reducing Canada\u2019s carbon emissions. He\u2019s given both pipeline proponents and opponents hope to cling to. Inevitably, one side or the other faces major disappointment.</p><p class="videoInfo videoInfo--border videoInfo-headline">Justin Trudeau aims to bring politicians together over pipelines (CP Video)</p><p>Take Wednesday\u2019s announcement that, in addition to expanding consultations with affected First Nations, the government will impose a climate test on the Trans Mountain and Energy East pipelines, assessing the upstream greenhouse-gas emissions generated by each project. Depending on the assumptions used, those emissions will either be quite minimal or colossal.</p><p>Differing assumptions left the U.S. State Department and Environmental Protection Agency at odds over the impact TransCanada\u2019s Keystone XL pipeline would have on greenhouse-gas emissions. It\u2019s reasonable to expect a similar clash (behind closed doors, at least) between Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr and Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, whose respective roles position them as antagonists in any debate over oil-sands development.</p><p>The issue centres on whether the construction of Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain expansion or TransCanada\u2019s Energy East would lead to an increase in oil-sands production that would not otherwise occur. In the case of Keystone, the State Department concluded that \u201cthe approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project \u2026 is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of expansion in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil in the United States.\u201d</p><p>The EPA took an opposing view, arguing that declining oil prices rendered alternative transportation methods, such as oil-by-rail, uneconomical for oil-sands producers. Hence, blocking Keystone would landlock the 830,000 daily barrels of oil it sought to transport. Approving Keystone, the EPA countered, would \u201cchange the economics of oil-sands development and result in increased oil-sands production and the accompanying greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d</p><p>Similar reasoning was used by the Pembina Institute in a 2014 study that estimated the upstream greenhouse-gas emissions from Energy East at more than 30 million tonnes, stemming from an increase in oil-sands production of up to 750,000 barrels per day. By comparison, current oil-sands production generates about 70 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The Alberta government proposes to cap oil-sands emissions at 100 million tonnes.</p><p>\u201cThere is an important distinction between the transportation costs that existing producers are willing to pay and the conditions needed to encourage future production growth,\u201d the Pembina study said. \u201cSo, while rail can be a complement and a stop-gap, oil-sands producers want to see large-capacity pipelines built to give them the confidence to invest in new operations.\u201d</p><p>That point of view was contrasted in a discussion paper produced for the Ontario Energy Board by environmental consulting firm Navius Research, that the OEB called \u201cthe most comprehensive Canadian analysis to date on the relationship between pipeline projects and climate change.\u201d It found that rail would indeed make up for a lack of pipelines, estimating that Energy East would lead to an increase in oil-sands production of about only 90,000 barrels per day, or less than 10 per cent of the proposed pipeline\u2019s 1.1-million-barrel-per-day capacity.</p><p>In its projection of future Canadian energy supply, released Wednesday, the National Energy Board estimated that even in its \u201cpipeline constrained\u201d scenario, domestic oil production would rise to 5.6 million barrels a day by 2040. That\u2019s just 8 per cent less than the 6.1 million barrels per day the federal agency projects would be produced with new pipelines and higher prices.</p><p>What\u2019s more, current analyses of upstream greenhouse gases assume that the emissions intensity of oil-sands crude remains constant. But that intensity has declined dramatically in recent decades and, depending on your faith in science, can reasonably be expected to decline in the future. As the Navius report noted: \u201cProducers are constantly developing new and more efficient ways of extracting bitumen.\u201d</p><p>Still, not even a favourable upstream emissions assessment will placate environmental groups, more than 70 of which released an open letter Wednesday calling for Canada to \u201cturn away from carbon-enabling infrastructure\u201d such as pipelines and to \u201cleave carbon in the ground.\u201d</p><p>Sooner or later, Mr. Trudeau must resign himself to the fact that he can\u2019t please everyone.</p><p class="article__ontwitter">Follow Konrad Yakabuski on Twitter: @konradyakabuski</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/?service=rss', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/eventually-trudeau-will-have-to-disappoint-someone-on-pipelines/article28437986/', u'author': u'KONRAD YAKABUSKI', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/eventually-trudeau-will-have-to-disappoint-someone-on-pipelines/article28437986/?cmpid=rss1', u'scraped_on': 1454013440, u'published_date': u'Thu, 28 Jan 2016 15:21:52 -0500', u'title': u'Eventually, Trudeau will have to disappoint someone on pipelines', u'_id': ObjectId('56aa7c031d41c8665ddc1c62'), u'media_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/'}

He is scheduled to meet Premier Rachel Notley on Feb. 3. Meanwhile, the headlines are only\xa0getting worse. The latest cheery news from the western front?</p><p>Investment plans by small and midsize Alberta businesses (companies with up to 500 employees) are plunging, according to a new study\xa0by the Montreal-based Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC).\xa0</p><p>After polling\xa0500 smaller Alberta firms\xa0across a variety of sectors,\xa0the BDC found\xa0that business spending is expected to crater\xa0by 27 per cent this year, to $11 billion. With Alberta facing a second straight year of recession, only\xa0one in three firms expect revenues to rise.</p><p>The gloomy findings in Alberta contrast sharply with the picture nationwide.\xa0Overall, the BDC\xa0says business spending among the 4,000 small to midsize firms\xa0it surveyed across Canada\xa0is expected\xa0to stay\xa0flat this year, at\xa0about $111 billion.</p><p>In British Columbia, where a wave of foreign cash is driving real estate prices to the moon, spurring the\xa0province\u2019s economy,\xa0business spending\xa0among smaller firms is expected to spike\xa0by 14 per cent this year to roughly $33 billion.</p><p>Ontario firms project an increase of two per cent to $44 billion, the BDC says.\xa0Alberta is\xa0the only province showing an outright decline.</p><p>The struggles of\xa0small firms mirrors the ongoing carnage in Alberta\u2019s\xa0oilpatch.\xa0With crude\xa0prices plunging\xa070 per cent since June 2014, and oil pipelines blocked by the eco zealots and their political pals,\xa0Alberta\u2019s energy\xa0producers have taken an axe to their\xa0capital budgets.</p><p>Dozens of major projects have been cancelled and capital spending has been slashed by tens of billions of dollars.\xa0</p><p>\u201cDefinitely, the fact that there is less investment in the energy sector is having an impact,\u201d\xa0 says Pierre Cleroux, chief economist at the federally owned bank.</p><p>\u201cSmall and midsize firms are a big part of the value chain in the energy sector. So when you see less investment (in the oilpatch), you also see smaller companies that\xa0don\u2019t do as much business\xa0and aren\u2019t\xa0investing as much. That\u2019s a direct impact of lower investment in the oil sector.\u201d</p><p>Since capital spending in the energy sector\xa0once accounted for nearly a third of all business investment in Canada, the\xa0ripple effects of the cuts\xa0continues to spread.\xa0</p><p>Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. now\xa0says\xa0house prices\xa0in oil-rich Alberta and Saskatchewan face\xa0a\xa0high risk of a correction.\xa0Meanwhile,\xa0new data from\xa0Statistics Canada\xa0shows\xa0that Alberta lost 19,600 jobs last year, making it\xa0the worst year\xa0for job losses\xa0since the early 1980s.</p><p>That\u2019s\xa0when another Trudeau \u2014 then\xa0prime minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau \u2014 cut\xa0Alberta\u2019s economy off at the knees by imposing\xa0the National Energy Program (NEP).\xa0</p><p>Now, Trudeau junior\xa0seems intent on inflicting NEP 2.0 on Alberta. Not by confiscating the province\u2019s rapidly depleting oil wealth, of course, but\xa0by failing to support the energy industry\xa0when it needs it most, while offering little but\xa0glib platitudes.</p><p>While former prime minister Stephen Harper moved quickly to bail out Ontario\u2019s struggling auto industry in the wake of the last recession, Trudeau has thus far offered nothing, while\xa0throwing up even more barriers for new pipeline projects.</p><p>\u201cEverywhere, projects are stalled (or being cancelled) not only by poor market conditions, but also by laborious regulatory procedures, political resistance, aboriginal claims, court rulings and hard-line environmentalists,\u201d notes\xa0Globe and\xa0Mail columnist Jeffrey Simpson, who is hardly known as a fan of Alberta\u2019s energy industry.</p><p>\u201cA lot of companies have already gone home or put projects on long-term hold, so difficult is the Canadian environment. The federal government is not making things any better with confusing statements about whether it wants development or doesn\u2019t, and on what terms.\u201d</p><p>Isn\u2019t\xa0that the truth.\xa0Hours\xa0after he\xa0told a crowd of Davos billionaires he wants Canada to be known more for its \u201cresourcefulness\u201d than its \u201cresources\u201d \u2014 a pointed jab at\xa0Harper \u2014 Trudeau seemed to offer support for TransCanada\u2019s proposed Energy East pipeline project.</p><p>But as usual, that didn\u2019t last long. On Wednesday, the Liberals rolled out\xa0new measures \u2014 including a climate assessment test and further\xa0consultation requirements for\xa0First Nations \u2014 that will inflict months of further\xa0delays on the absurdly lengthy review\xa0process that already exists for new pipelines.</p><p>Oddly,\xa0while Canada seems intent on destroying its own energy industry, the rest of the planet \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014\xa0can\u2019t pump enough oil\xa0or build new pipelines fast enough.

{u'full_article': u'<p>OTTAWA \u2014 The Liberal government has added two new\xa0review mechanisms\xa0to how major\xa0new pipeline proposals are assessed. Here are some quotes on the announcement:</p><p>"We believe it is important and, in fact, essential to rebuild Canadians\' trust in our environmental assessment processes. We need to take into account the views and concerns of Canadians, respect the rights and interests of indigenous peoples and support our natural resources sector." Environment Minister Catherine McKenna.</p><p>___</p><p>"The government of Canada is free to establish its own review and its own criteria for those reviews in whatever context it chooses. And the cabinet ultimately will decide \u2014 weighing all the factors that are important to determine the national interest for these major projects." Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr.</p><p>___</p><p>"We support a strong and clear regulatory framework that helps Canadians see our commitment to building and operating oil and gas pipelines in the safest and most environmentally sound way possible. TransCanada operates in a highly regulated industry. We will continue to work with all levels of government and our regulators to ensure the continued safe and environmentally sound transportation of our natural resources to market." TransCanada spokesman Mark Cooper.</p><p>___</p><p>"While we have concerns about how this delay could impact the project schedule, we support the principle that public confidence in the review process is crucial and look forward to working with the Government of Canada on how our years of work in the area of consultation will be considered. We are confident we can demonstrate to Canadians, both the need for this Project and our commitment to building and operating this pipeline to the highest standards of environmental performance while supporting Aboriginal communities and providing lasting benefits for all Canadians." Ian Anderson, president of Kinder Morgan Canada.</p><p>___</p><p>"This is not good news for the natural resources sector. This another layer, another process." Conservative energy critic Candice Bergen.</p><p>___</p><p>"We have done our part to earn that confidence of Canadians. Now the federal government is, (through) this interim solution, attempting to have that honest conversation and ensure that voices are heard so that we can get to a decision on these matters." Alberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips.</p><p>___</p><p>\u201cWhile we welcome this attempt by the federal government to clean up the broken regulatory process left behind by the Harper government, today\u2019s announcement does little to address our longstanding concerns with the Kinder Morgan pipeline review process." Karen Campbell, Ecojustice lawyer.</p><p>___</p><p>"We are encouraged that the federal government is finally listening to the concerns of Canadians with its new transitional pipeline review process. However, it doesn\u2019t make sense that Energy East would fall under anything but a completely reformed process. As Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr acknowledged, the National Energy Board (NEB) hasn\u2019t yet deemed the Energy East application complete; the review has not begun. If the transitional process is just for projects under review, it shouldn\u2019t apply to Energy East." Adam Scott of Environmental Defence.</p><p>___</p><p>\u201cIf this new process is rigorous and the government does what it says it will do, they will come to the inevitable conclusion that the Kinder Morgan pipeline cannot be built. That is what the science says, that is what the communities say and that is what the First Nations are saying.\u201d Sven Biggs, pipeline campaigner for ForestEthics Advocacy.</p><p>___</p><p>"The truth is that the current system must be totally replaced. The National Energy Board has only been doing environmental assessments since the previous Conservative government gutted the environmental assessment process with C-38 in 2012. It is ill-suited for the role and woefully inexperienced. We need to return to the regime as it existed before the previous Conservative government took an axe to it. We need to build on what worked." Green party Leader Elizabeth May.</p><p>___</p><p>\u201cThe Trudeau government has a big job on its hands fixing pipeline reviews in this country. The recent audit of the NEB reveals deep flaws in the institution, while the board itself is dominated by individuals with a background in the fossil fuel industry. There is also the ongoing priority to reverse and then strengthen the many changes made by Harper that derailed our environmental regulations.\u201d Maude Barlow, national chairperson of the Council of Canadians.</p><p>___</p><p>\u201cIn addition to these review rules, Canada must establish a science-based climate plan that includes minimum standards on carbon pricing, and that builds upon existing provincial action. Existing provincial climate commitments will not ensure Canada meets its 2030 emissions reductions goal, and are not sufficient to ensure Canada lives up to its fair share of the Paris Agreement."\xa0Erin Flanagan, federal policy director at the Pembina Institute.</p><p>___</p><p>\u201cGreenpeace applauds Prime Minister Trudeau for taking the first steps in reforming the badly flawed environmental review process and adding an integral step to infrastructure reviews. The new rules must ensure that all energy projects are in line with Canada\u2019s commitment to doing its part to stabilize global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees. That means no new tar sands mines or pipelines." Peter Louwe of Greenpeace.</p><p>___</p><p>"Recovery of the national economy depends on getting these pipelines built but we also need to accept that this will not happen without public support. What will be critical now is everyone stepping up to the plate so we do not face further delays. Everyone involved will need to consider not just their local interest but also the national interest." Dylan Jones, president of the Canada West Foundation.</p><p>___</p><p>\xa0"What will be important to our members and to the upstream oil and gas industry is how will this affect the in-service date of the projects and we\'ll be looking into that in the coming days.\xa0I think we have an obligation to have a thorough and robust regulatory and environmental oversight, but we should always be conscious of not duplicating the process." Tim McMillan, head of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.</p><p>___</p><p>\xa0</p><p>\xa0</p><p>\xa0</p><p>\xa0</p><p>\xa0</p><p>\xa0</p><p>\xa0</p><p>\xa0</p><p>The Canadian Press</p><p>\xa92016 The Canadian Press</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://cjme.com/rss-feed/6194', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://cjme.com/article/448833/quotes-liberal-governments-environmental-review-announcement', u'author': u'The Canadian Press', u'original_article_url': u'http://cjme.com/article/448833/quotes-liberal-governments-environmental-review-announcement', u'scraped_on': 1453947472, u'published_date': u'Wed, 27 Jan 16 19:29:29 -0600', u'title': u"Quotes on the Liberal government's environmental review announcement", u'_id': ObjectId('56a97a501d41c845267eedd0'), u'media_url': u'http://cjme.com/'}

It has one of those already.</p>&#13;<p>What it needs is politicians with more courage to push through projects that receive approval from the National Energy Board (NEB).</p>&#13;<p>On Wednesday, federal Liberal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr released some interim measures for reviewing the Trans Mountain and Energy East pipeline projects. They won\u2019t help a bit to get needed pipelines built.</p>&#13;<p>Carr\u2019s six interim guidelines are reminiscent of British Columbia\u2019s five hoops through which Alberta and oil companies must jump to get permission to build a pipeline to the West Coast.</p>&#13;<p>I have called the B.C. criteria, introduced in 2012 in connection with the Northern Gateway approval process, the \u201cmoving goalposts.\u201d</p>&#13;<p>The conditions were designed intentionally so they could never be satisfied. Whenever Alberta or Gateway\u2019s owners, Enbridge, got close to meeting one or more of the conditions, the B.C. government could change the requirements slightly and never have to say \u201cyes.\u201d</p>&#13;<p>The federal Liberals\u2019 interim measures are very similar.</p>&#13;<p>British Columbia required a comprehensive environmental review, full participation by and benefits for First Nations and a \u201cfair share\u201d of fiscal and economic benefits for their province.</p>&#13;<p>Carr insists Trans Mountain and Energy East may only move forward after there have been \u201cdeeper consultations with Indigenous peoples,\u201d better analysis of environmental impacts and appointment of \u201ca ministerial representative to engage communities \u2026 potentially affected by the project\u201d and ensure those communities are happy.</p>&#13;<p>B.C.\u2019s conditions were political cover and so are the Trudeau government\u2019s. They are so broad and so ill-defined that the Liberals could easily use them to deny construction permits to Kinder Morgan (Trans Mountain) and TransCanada (Energy East), no matter how many conditions the companies satisfy.</p>&#13;<p>Public opinion polls, not technical or scientific reviews, will determine whether the pipelines Alberta needs will proceed. If loud environmentalists and trendy editorialists continue to oppose pipelines out of alarmism over climate change, Carr, Trudeau and the Liberals will simply say \u201csorry, our conditions haven\u2019t been met. You can\u2019t have your pipelines.\u201d</p>&#13;<p>This is all about politics and nothing about \u201crestoring public confidence in the environmental review process\u201d as the prime minister and Natural Resources minister claim.</p>&#13;<p>The Northern Gateway review was the most extensive in the history of Canadian pipelines. After nearly three years of review and nearly 2,000 public submissions, the NEB approved the project to carry Alberta bitumen to a tanker port on the B.C. coast \u2013 with 209 conditions attached.</p>&#13;<p>But that wasn\u2019t good enough for the goalpost-moving B.C. government or for the extremely well-funded environmental activists opposed to the project. So even without a Parliamentary motion, back in November Trudeau effectively killed Northern Gateway by directing his Transportation minister to impose a tanker ban on the West Coast.</p>&#13;<p>Gateway might get built, but the oil couldn\u2019t go anywhere. So it is unlikely investors would ever spend the money to construct it.</p>&#13;<p>No matter what the Liberals do to change the NEB process, some provinces and most eco-activists will remain opposed to every pipeline. It\u2019s not the possibility of a pipeline leak or a tanker spill they\u2019re truly worried about. They\u2019re opposed to what\u2019s in the pipeline \u2013 oil, a carbon-based fuel that they worry will cause dangerous climate change.</p>&#13;<p>There is no way any review process can satisfy these extremists.</p>&#13;<p>That\u2019s why Carr\u2019s and the Liberals\u2019 interim measures are a fraud. So long as Quebec and B.C. remain opposed to pipelines (and so long as the Liberals want votes there more than in Alberta), all the new measures do is give Ottawa a convenient tool to kill the projects.</p>&#13;&#13;&#13;&#13;<p class="ga-bottom" id="ga-bottom-main"></p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.edmontonsun.com/opinion/rss.xml', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.edmontonsun.com/2016/01/27/new-initiatives-are-so-ill-defined-the-liberals-could-deny-permits-no-matter-how-many-conditions-are-met', u'author': u'None', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.edmontonsun.com/2016/01/27/new-initiatives-are-so-ill-defined-the-liberals-could-deny-permits-no-matter-how-many-conditions-are-met', u'scraped_on': 1453949257, u'published_date': u'Wed, 27 Jan 2016 19:26:08 MST', u'title': u'New initiatives are so ill-defined the Liberals could deny permits no matter how many conditions are met', u'_id': ObjectId('56a9814b1d41c845ca66c1ce'), u'media_url': u'http://www.edmontonsun.com/'}

{u'full_article': u'<p>Mark Milke is a Calgary author.</p><p>In the lead-up to Confederation in 1867, one perennial concern was how the small-minded provincialism of local politicians made it difficult for merchants and travellers alike to criss-cross British North America.</p><p>Thus, in 1865, George Brown, founder of The Globe newspaper and a reform-minded politician in the Province of Canada\u2019s Legislative Assembly, compared travel to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick as akin to visiting a foreign country, where a \u201ccustoms officer meets you at the frontier, arrests your progress and levies his imposts on your effects.\u201d</p><p>That problem of artificial barriers (provincial tariffs on one\u2019s goods, for example) was one reason why Brown favoured the prospect of Confederation, and he was not alone. New Brunswick legislator John McMillan, also speaking in 1865, argued in favour of a \u201cunion of the provinces\u201d because, among other benefits, it would \u201cenable us to have free trade with our neighbours [and be] commercially the best step we could take.\u201d</p><p>Likewise, George-\xc9tienne Cartier, co-premier with John A. Macdonald for a spell in the late 1850s and early 1860s in the Province of Canada, saw that it was precisely because a cacophony of local interests existed, and could unnecessarily interfere in greater coast-to-coast prosperity, that \u201cthe federation system ought to be resorted to and would be found to work well.\u201d His colleagues, listening to his speech in February, 1865, responded with \u201cHear, hear.\u201d</p><p>Brown, McMillan, Cartier and other early politicians envisioned a Canada with a dominion (federal) government that would promote, protect and ensure the national interest. That included a free flow of goods, services and national projects. It was necessary to counter the inevitable tendency of the occasional puffed-up provincial potentate to otherwise obstruct nation building, a grander Canadian identity and a wider and deeper prosperity.</p><p>In contrast to those mid-19th century statesmen, a recent example of local potentates just popped up in Montreal.</p><p>There, Mayor Denis Coderre and other area politicians have made clear they oppose the Energy East pipeline proposed by TransCanada. That\u2019s the one that would ship 1.1 million barrels of oil daily from the Western Canada sedimentary basin to refineries in Quebec and New Brunswick. Energy East could potentially replace $8-billion worth of imported oil from Saudi Arabia and other countries that now flow into Central and Eastern Canada.</p><p>Mr. Coderre and others oppose the possible Canadian/foreign oil \u201cswap\u201d due to a psychological need for perfection: \u201cWhen it comes to transporting oil, we need a perfect score, and we cannot make mistakes,\u201d he opined in a recent column in The Calgary Herald.</p><p>Perfection is not a realistic demand, least of all for politicians or pipelines, or even for the Earth itself, considering how it groans, shudders, erupts and cracks tectonic plates, among other unpredictable activities. But for those who prefer to deal in reality, here\u2019s a useful fact: Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil, as Michel Kelly-Gagnon, president of the Montreal Economic Institute, has pointed out. But Mr. Coderre already knows that from Quebec\u2019s recent tragic encounter with another form of oil transportation: rail.</p><p>As part of his quest for absolutism against a tube that carries black liquid used by Quebeckers and everyone else, Mr. Coderre mentions his concern about carbon emissions. On such a matter, the mayor desires to reassure fellow politicians, such as those he recently met at the United Nations climate conference in Paris.</p><p>But Energy East is not just about finding a domestic market for Western oil production, it\u2019s also about displacing imports. And no honest person thinks the world will soon end its reliance on 96 million barrels of oil, daily. Thus Mr. Coderre\u2019s reality-ignoring position mimics the naysaying more often found among hard-line energy opponents who harbour romantic visions about a pre-energy Eden.</p><p>One would think Mr. Coderre and his colleagues would be more pragmatic. That includes recognizing it is oil and gas that help Quebeckers endure winter, and that such energy assists everyone else on the planet with much else. But the mayor\u2019s demand is born from a political marriage of theatrics and histrionics.</p><p>In blessed contrast to local Montreal politicians, Quebec City Mayor R\xe9gis Labeaume supports Energy East. As he told one reporter: \u201cIn a normal country, all organizations that want to build infrastructure for transporting energy should be able to do it.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Labeaume thus echoes the optimistic, entrepreneurial and national sentiments of statesmen at the time of Confederation such as Cartier, McMillan and others, or indeed of Brown, who in his 1865 speech, also advocated for a \u201cscheme\u201d \u2013 Confederation \u2013 to help Canadians develop our \u201cgreat natural resources.\u201d</p><p class="article__ontwitter">Follow us on Twitter: @GlobeBusiness</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/?service=rss', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/canadas-national-interest-has-always-trumped-the-local-potentates/article28418513/', u'author': u'Mark Milke', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/canadas-national-interest-has-always-trumped-the-local-potentates/article28418513/?cmpid=rss1', u'scraped_on': 1453975610, u'published_date': u'Thu, 28 Jan 2016 05:00:00 -0500', u'title': u'Canada\u2019s national interest has always trumped the local potentates', u'_id': ObjectId('56a9e83d1d41c84ddf4507f6'), u'media_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/'}
{u'full_article': u'<p>When B.C. Premier Christy Clark\u2019s government rejected the expansion of Kinder Morgan Canada\u2019s Trans Mountain pipeline earlier this month, no questions were raised about the threat to national unity. When eco-friendly Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson later applauded his province\u2019s decision, it wasn\u2019t seen as \u201cpetty politics.\u201d</p><p>So why is Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre\u2019s rejection of the Energy East pipeline tagged as \u201cparochial\u201d? Mr. Coderre, speaking for mayors representing the four million residents of the Greater Montreal area, said the project currently on the table is not acceptable. He raised concerns about possible oil leaks in a fragile environment and said the risks, as of now, greatly outweigh the small economic benefits for the Montreal area.</p><p>The outrage in many quarters was spectacular. Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall suggested Quebec might return its equalization payments if it so dislikes Canadian oil. Others presented the pipeline as a \u201cnation-building\u201d project. To abandon it would threaten Canada\u2019s very existence, it seems. Is this a new transcontinental railway?</p><p>Many mayors and groups across the country, including First Nations leaders, have raised concerns about, if not outright opposition to, TransCanada\u2019s Energy East project. The Ontario Energy Board, in a report last summer, was critical of the pipeline, asked that it be rerouted and said an oil-spill cleanup could cost $1-billion.</p><p>You can call it the NIMBY syndrome (not in my backyard); you can debate the fantasy-like concept of zero environmental risk. You can argue that the project is good for Canada, maybe vital to some areas.</p><p>But why is it that when the opposition comes from Quebec, it is seen to be un-Canadian?</p><p>Mr. Coderre, a former federal minister, would make a poor mascot for Quebec\u2019s independence movement (an option that touched a new low, at 34 per cent, last week, according to a CROP poll). His Liberal and federalist credentials can be detected in his DNA.</p><p>It\u2019s true that Quebec receives the most from the national equalization program, and it\u2019s true that Quebeckers like to think of themselves as greener then green, and generally underestimate the economic benefits of the oil industry for all of Canada.</p><p>But does this mean environmental concerns are unacceptable if they come from a \u201chave-not\u201d province? Does it mean everyone in Quebec should just shut up?</p><p>So Mr. Coderre is criticized for defending the interests of Montreal-area residents, allegedly without thinking about the consequences for the rest of the country. As opposed to other, more enlightened, politicians whose first thought is for people outside their constituencies? Please provide us with a picture of such a politician.</p><p>For now, TransCanada Corp. has done a poor job of selling the project. The National Energy Board has yet to approve it. The Montreal-area mayors are not part of a separatist plot. And if you read correctly, the opposition is not irrevocable.</p><p>When push comes to shove, the federal government will have the final say. Meanwhile, words of contempt and inflammatory rhetoric against Quebec political leaders might hurt national unity more than legitimate protests from local politicians.</p><p>-----------------------------</p><p>yves.boisvert@lapresse.ca</p><p class="article__ontwitter">Follow us on Twitter: @GlobeDebate</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/?service=rss', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-is-it-un-canadian-for-quebeckers-to-oppose-a-pipeline/article28423438/', u'author': u'YVES BOISVERT', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-is-it-un-canadian-for-quebeckers-to-oppose-a-pipeline/article28423438/?cmpid=rss1', u'scraped_on': 1453979231, u'published_date': u'Thu, 28 Jan 2016 06:00:00 -0500', u'title': u'Why is it un-Canadian for Quebeckers to oppose a pipeline?', u'_id': ObjectId('56a9f6601d41c84eb15efff4'), u'media_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/'}
{u'full_article': u'<p>The Energy East pipeline proposed route is pictured as TransCanada officials speak during a news conference in Calgary, on Aug. 1, 2013.Jeff McIntosh / THE CANADIAN PRESS</p><p>Montreal has long been an important hub for transportation infrastructure \u2014 a hub that connects Canada from coast to coast to coast, and a hub that connects Canada to the world.</p><p>Every day, be it by railway, road or the Saint Lawrence Seaway, goods move through the city on their way to other parts of Canada or from Canada to international markets. Quebec and Canada are stronger because of it \u2014 transportation infrastructure is the foundation of Canada\u2019s collective economic strength.</p><p>Building Energy East is a nationally important piece of transportation infrastructure. It would allow Quebec refineries to use Canadian crude oil instead of imports, and it would connect New Brunswick and markets abroad to Canada\u2019s vast oil resources. All Canadians, including people in Quebec, would benefit as a result.</p><p>We need a unified national will to turn this vision into reality.</p><p>Some say the environmental risks of building Energy East outweigh the economic benefits. This argument, however, overlooks the larger benefits of Canadian oil infrastructure to Quebec and Canada, as well as the industry\u2019s safety record.</p><p>Canadian Energy Pipeline Association data shows that between 2002 and 2013, pipelines transported oil with a 99.999 per cent safety record. This includes pipelines that feed refineries in Quebec.</p><p>These refineries process oil, much of which arrives in Quebec from foreign sources such as the United States, Algeria, Angola and Kazakhstan at higher prices than Canadian oil.</p><p>The province spent nearly $14 billion in 2013 on oil imports, according to government data. That\u2019s the equivalent of the annual economic activity created by Canada\u2019s beer sector, founded in Montreal by the Molson family, and it\u2019s money that flows out of the province, with little in the way of economic return.</p><p>Canada has the third-largest oil reserves in the world, yet much of the oil for Quebec and Atlantic Canada is imported.</p><p>Expanding pipeline infrastructure in Quebec and Atlantic Canada will allow us to keep the money spent on imports in Canada, where it can help create jobs and grow the economy. That, indeed, would be a substantial economic benefit in addition to the benefits from oilsands development Quebec already enjoys.</p><p>The Canadian oilsands sector has purchased $600 million in goods and services from Quebec over the past two years. More than 190 Quebec companies, many in the Montreal area, have direct business relationships with the oilsands. By expanding Canada\u2019s pipeline infrastructure, we can build on these benefits and stimulate the kind of economic activity that keeps people working.</p><p>And this is the crux of my argument: Pipelines are nationally important infrastructure that helps build Canada\u2019s economic strength, just like highways and railroads. These Canadian infrastructure projects will generate revenue and create jobs, all without any taxpayer funding. The ability for Canadian oil to have more access to more markets is critical for the industry, the national economy and the prosperity of all Canadians, including people in Quebec.</p><p class="p1">In view of Alberta\u2019s stringent carbon policy and climate leadership plan, using responsibly produced Canadian oil in Quebec is also an opportunity to displace oil from foreign countries that have less stringent environmental standards. Many of the oil suppliers to Quebec do not have the regulatory system or transparent environmental reporting Canada has.</p><p>Environment Canada reports that emissions per barrel of oil produced from the oilsands are down 30 per cent from 1990 levels. Pilot projects in the oilsands, such as the use of solvents for in situ projects, will reduce emissions even further.</p><p>These are some facts that should inform a reasonable debate about how Canada collectively can take action to build the pipeline infrastructure that will make our provinces and country stronger.</p><p>We should all get behind this effort to slice through the Gordian knot that prevents our country from reaping the full benefits of our abundant oil and natural gas resources.</p><p>Tim McMillan is president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

{u'full_article': u'<p>OTTAWA \u2014 Five things to know about pipeline approvals in Canada:</p><p>\u2014 National Energy Board hearings on Kinder Morgan twinning its Trans Mountain pipeline are almost over; the government is extending the deadline for a decision by four months, pushing it to next December, to allow for an examination of the greenhouse gas emissions created during the extraction and processing of oil destined for the new line. In the case of TransCanada\'s controversial Energy East project, for which hearings have not yet begun, the government is extending the project review period by an extra six months and adding three temporary members to the National Energy Board in an effort to do greater public consultation.</p><p>\u2014 The government will appoint a ministerial adviser to consult with indigenous communities along the Trans Mountain and Energy East pipelines routes, effectively creating a parallel process to the National Energy Board review. Ultimately, said Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, "cabinet will decide" on the fate of the pipelines.</p><p>\u2014 The government\'s new transitory review process was promptly panned by the federal Conservatives, who framed it as another layer of bureaucracy and red tape aimed at slowing resource development in Canada, designed by a party that\'s ideologically opposed to the idea of developing natural resources writ large. "This sends a terrible signal to investors," said Tory MP Candice Bergen, who said it\'s far from the "glimmer of hope" the energy sector had been looking for.</p><p>\u2014 According to the National Energy Board\'s 2016 energy forecast report, new pipeline developments are less a factor in pushing up Canadian oil production than is the benchmark price per barrel. The report suggests that "although pipeline infrastructure may impact Canadian oil production, it is one of many factors that may do so. The High and Low Price cases suggest that crude oil prices, driven by global supply and demand dynamics, are also an important \u2014 perhaps the most important \u2014 determinant of Canadian production growth."</p><p>\u2014 The Calgary-based National Energy Board has regulated pipelines in Canada since 1959. It oversees approval and compliance issues for 73,000 kilometres of oil and gas pipelines that in 2014 moved about $162 billion worth of product.</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/search/?c%5B%5D=news%2Fnational%2A&d=&d1=&d2=&f=rss&l=25&q=&s=start_time&sd=desc&t=article', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/news/national/five-things-to-know-about-ottawa-s-new-review-process/article_5cd2c90c-50d5-5799-85b2-3fd3e2726dee.html', u'author': u'None', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/news/national/five-things-to-know-about-ottawa-s-new-review-process/article_5cd2c90c-50d5-5799-85b2-3fd3e2726dee.html', u'scraped_on': 1453940371, u'published_date': u'Wed, 27 Jan 2016 18:10:28 -0500', u'title': u"Five Things to know about Ottawa's new review process for resource projects", u'_id': ObjectId('56a95e931d41c83cb074a24b'), u'media_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/'}

{u'full_article': u'<p>OTTAWA \u2014 Five things to know about pipeline approvals in Canada:</p><p>\u2014 National Energy Board hearings on Kinder Morgan twinning its\xa0Trans Mountain pipeline\xa0are almost over; the government is extending the deadline for a decision by four months, pushing it to next December, to allow for an examination of the greenhouse gas emissions created during the extraction and processing of oil destined for the new line.\xa0In the case of TransCanada\'s controversial Energy East project,\xa0for which hearings have not yet begun, the government is extending the project review period by an extra six months and adding three temporary members to the National Energy Board in an effort to do greater public consultation.</p><p>\u2014 The government will appoint\xa0a ministerial adviser to consult with indigenous communities along the Trans Mountain and Energy East pipelines routes, effectively creating a parallel process to the National Energy Board review. Ultimately, said Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr, "cabinet will decide" on the fate of the pipelines.\xa0</p><p>\u2014 The government\'s new transitory review process was promptly panned by the federal Conservatives, who framed it as another layer of bureaucracy and red tape aimed at slowing resource development in Canada, designed by a party that\'s ideologically opposed to the idea of\xa0developing natural resources\xa0writ large. "This sends a terrible signal to investors," said\xa0Tory MP Candice Bergen, who said it\'s far from the "glimmer of hope" the energy sector had been looking for.</p><p>\u2014 According to the National Energy Board\'s 2016 energy forecast report, new pipeline developments are less a factor in pushing up\xa0Canadian oil production than is the benchmark price per barrel. The report suggests\xa0that "although pipeline infrastructure may impact Canadian oil production, it is one of many factors that may do so. The High and Low Price cases suggest that crude oil prices, driven by global supply and demand dynamics, are also an important \u2014 perhaps the most important\xa0\u2014 determinant of Canadian production growth."</p><p>\u2014 The Calgary-based National Energy Board has regulated pipelines in Canada since 1959. It oversees approval and compliance issues for\xa073,000 kilometres of oil and gas pipelines that in 2014 moved about $162 billion worth of product.</p><p>The Canadian Press</p><p>\xa92016 The Canadian Press</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://cjme.com/rss-feed/3', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://cjme.com/article/448550/five-things-know-about-ottawas-new-review-process-resource-projects', u'author': u'The Canadian Press', u'original_article_url': u'http://cjme.com/article/448550/five-things-know-about-ottawas-new-review-process-resource-projects', u'scraped_on': 1453944738, u'published_date': u'Wed, 27 Jan 16 17:10:28 -0600', u'title': u"Five Things to know about Ottawa's new review process for resource projects", u'_id': ObjectId('56a96fa21d41c841e1d9cc61'), u'media_url': u'http://cjme.com/'}

However, the glib way you dismissed the value of Canadian natural resources was not helpful.</p><p class="p1">Please use your very considerable resourcefulness to help our economy. We need to transport our resources to the markets that need them.</p><p class="p1">There will be no sunny ways in this part of Canada until you do.</p><p class="p1">Liz Watson, Calgary</p>PM isn\u2019t consistent<p class="p1">On Nov. 15, 2015, less than one month after becoming prime minister, Justin Trudeau, without consultation, ordered a moratorium on B.C.\u2019s north coast tanker traffic. This unilateral decision in effect killed the Northern Gateway pipeline \xa0project for the foreseeable future.</p><p class="p1">Yet in Montreal on Tuesday, after meeting with Mayor Denis Coderre on the Energy East pipeline, Trudeau very conveniently proclaimed that it was not up to the federal government to decide which project should get the go ahead or not. According to him, it was up to TransCanada Corp. to demonstrate that the project was in the public interest, had social acceptability and was environmentally sound.</p><p class="p1">Why the double-talk, Mr. Prime Minister?</p><p class="p1">Bernard Bonneau, Calgary</p>\xa0Too quick to criticize Trudeau<p class="p1">Re: \u201cJust imagine the conversation,\u201d Letter, Jan. 23.</p><p class="p1">Terry Brown alleges that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada no longer has a resource-based economy. Trudeau said no such thing. He said Canada is more than just energy.\xa0</p><p class="p1">I guess he was supposed to pitch the Canadian economy to the world on oil priced at $28 per barrel. Trudeau is criticized for dining with Leonardo DiCaprio in an effort to correct the latter\u2019s hypocritical musings on the Canadian energy sector.\xa0</p><p class="p1">Finally, Trudeau is criticized for flying on a government jet to Davos. Trudeau\u2019s activities were legitimate for a Canadian leader.\xa0 DiCaprio, plying his trade in the world of make believe, had no reason to be there.\xa0</p><p class="p1">This is no advocacy for Trudeau, just a rebuttal of the irrational whining too common in Alberta. If Brown is fired up and wants to blame someone for Alberta\u2019s plight, he should look south to the Americans, who have flooded the world market for oil and collapsed the oil price for everyone.\xa0</p><p class="p1">R.W.

The exception is 650,000 barrels per day of oil imported from places like Norway and the U.K. But that\u2019s OK, because in Europe, they don\u2019t emit greenhouse gases. They also use solar- and wind-powered tankers to ship it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada.</p><p class="p1">George Caouette, Calgary\xa0</p>Bright future for oil and gas<p class="p1">Alberta\u2019s crude oil resource is the largest, not the second- or third-largest, but the largest, on Earth.</p><p class="p1">Before the recent fall in oil prices, the total of all operating, in-construction, approved, in-approval, planned and announced oilsands projects would have resulted in more than 10\xa0million barrels per day\xa0of oil production, making Alberta the largest producer on Earth.</p><p class="p1">Innovation, infrastructure and investment by Canadians can improve recovery factors and economics of the oilsands to make Alberta\u2019s economically recoverable oil reserves the largest on Earth by far.</p><p class="p1">Every government, reputable non-government agency and energy company forecasts worldwide energy demand to keep increasing for decades, with the continued dominance of oil and gas in meeting that demand.</p><p class="p1">Increased production from Free World oilsands and shale production will drive despotic petro-states and organizations dependent on oil and gas revenues to their knees.\xa0</p><p class="p1">Mike Priaro, Calgary</p>Quebec should develop its resources<p class="p1">Here\u2019s some ideas for Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre. First of all, he has two choices: rail or pipe. Doesn\u2019t he know that all major rail lines run through Montreal, hence more tank cars, plus\xa0the fact the railways will use the shortest route to the East Coast.</p><p class="p1">\xa0Secondly, if he wants to deny Alberta the right to increase its revenue, perhaps it\u2019s time to reduce the amount of funds going into Quebec\u2019s equalization fund. After\xa0all, they have social programs\xa0that are cheaper than Alberta\u2019s, such as daycare and college tuition.</p><p class="p1">Why aren\u2019t they developing their own natural resources? Why isn\u2019t hydro\xa0electricity part of the equalization formula?</p><p class="p1">Finally, will B.C. Premier Christy Clark require a corridor to transport the natural gas and electricity from the Peace River area? If so, why not use it for an oil pipeline or any other infrastructure as\xa0required? While on this topic, will Trudeau\xa0ban gas tankers, as he has oil tankers?</p><p class="p1">In the future, there should be only one environmental session required, covering all new\xa0transportation, in order to expedite the process.</p><p class="p1">Donald C.

I would point out to Nelson that when Mark Twain wrote: \u201cTo a man with a hammer, every problem resembles a nail,\u201d he was not being complimentary.</p><p class="p1">Coderre does not speak for all Montrealers, and even less for all Quebecers.

{u'full_article': u'&#13;<p id="fb-root"/><p class="p1">Abitibi Bowater is at it again.</p><p class="p3">In 2010 the company squeezed $130 million out of Canadian taxpayers after the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador expropriated Abitibi\u2019s hydroelectric\xa0assets\xa0in Grand Falls-Windsor and took back water and timber rights.</p><p class="p3">The company threatened to sue Canada under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), prompting the Harper administration to settle out of court.</p><p class="p3">This all went down after Abitibi chose to pull out of the province and used the excuse of imminent bankruptcy to give minimum compensation to workers and pensioners, while paying nothing toward cleaning up the environmental damage it had caused.\xa0</p><p class="p3">The company never did go out of business; after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings under a new name, Resolute Forest Products, it was business as usual on the mainland. \xa0</p><p class="p3">This time the company closed down a mill in Shawinigan, Que., and is again suing under NAFTA because, it claims, a competing mill in Port Hawkesbury, N.S. was given an unfair trade advantage when it was subsidized by the Government of Nova Scotia.</p><p class="p3">The Port Hawkesbury mill closed in 2011 but was purchased by Pacific West Commercial for $33 million and reopened one year later with the guarantee of provincial government aid of approximately $12 million a year over a 10-year period. Today more than 1,000 people in Cape Breton are employed by Port Hawkesbury Paper. \xa0</p><p class="p3">In addition to claiming direct losses of around $70 million, Resolute Forest Products is seeking unspecified consequential damages that could ultimately mean much higher compensation.</p>What\u2019s wrong with this lawsuit?<p class="p3">At first glance, this lawsuit might appear reasonable to some. That is, until one considers two important points.</p><p class="p4">First, the original argument for including an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in NAFTA was to prevent governments from discriminating against foreign corporations in favour of local businesses. There is a loophole in NAFTA, however, which allows Canadian corporations to register in the United States and then claim they are American for the purpose of suing Canada. This can be done\xa0as a mail box company in the state of Delaware, for instance.</p><p class="p3">Resolute Forest Products\u2019 head office is in Montreal and, according to the company\u2019s website, the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the forests where it harvests trees are in Canada. Doesn\u2019t this\xa0suggest that Resolute\u2014like Calgary-based Lone Pine Resources, which is currently suing Canada for $118.9 million USD as a result of\xa0Quebec\u2019s decision to ban fracking in the interest of protecting the\xa0natural environment\u2014is really a Canadian company in American disguise?\xa0</p><p class="p3">Secondly, the Resolute Forest Products lawsuit could be a \u2018back door\u2019 challenge to the whole idea of subsidies. This is a new, and very significant, twist because trade agreements generally don\u2019t attempt to eliminate government\u2019s right to use subsidies to stimulate local economies. Even wildly pro-free trade governments haven\u2019t argued for that.</p><p class="p3">For example, the Comprehensive Economic\xa0and Trade Agreement (CETA) did not in any way address the huge subsidies European countries give to their fishing industries. This is why Newfoundland and Labrador\u2019s acquiescence to the elimination of the its minimum processing requirements (MPRs) that former governments had designed to protect local communities and local workers was very shortsighted, even with the $280 million MPR federal compensation fund. \xa0</p><p class="p3">What the Resolute Forest Products lawsuit suggests is that we now have very limited options when it comes to leveling the very uneven playing field that exists in the international fisheries. We can apparently forget the concept of provincial subsidies or bailouts to help local producers and local jobs, as they can be challenged by industry players in other provinces who happen to have European affiliates or have registered in the United States.</p><p class="p3">The Resolute Forest Product lawsuit shows how trade agreements can generate far-reaching consequences that governments never anticipated. Canada, in particular, has not been very smart in its pursuit of trade agreements. Just our NAFTA lawsuits alone have gained us the dubious distinction of being the most sued developed country in the world. The United States, by contrast, has yet to lose a NAFTA lawsuit.</p>Nova Scotia\u2019s other NAFTA lawsuit<p class="p3">This is the second time in a year that Nova Scotia has been implicated in a NAFTA lawsuit. In 2015, the Canadian government was successfully sued by Bilcon, a Delaware registered company, for denying the company\u2019s application to open a quarry in Nova Scotia. </p><p class="p3">A federal-provincial review panel had rejected the quarry on environmental grounds, but the arbitration panel decided that the company had been treated unfairly and ruled in its favour. Compensation could climb as high as $300 million even though the project never reached the construction stage. </p><p class="p3">One of the arbitrators in the case admitted the decision was a \u201cremarkable step backwards in environmental protection\u201d\xa0in Canada.</p>TransCanada\u2019s $15 billion lawsuit against the U.S.<p class="p2">TransCanada Corp. has just launched a $15 billion NAFTA claim for damages because of the U.S. decision (based largely on environmental concerns) to deny a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. The pipeline itself would apparently cost somewhere in the vicinity of $3 billion. The extra $12 billion is for the projected loss of future profits.\xa0</p><p class="p3">Given that Canada has its own pipeline issues, ones hopes the newly elected federal government is taking note. Don\u2019t count on it, though \u2014 Justin Trudeau\u2019s enthusiastic pursuit of another free trade deal with China suggests the new prime minister is as keen on signing trade agreements as his predecessor was.</p>Ideology trumps reality<p class="p3">The Canadian government\u2019s ideological belief\xa0that all trade must be good appears unshakeable \u2014 so unshakeable that politicians have continually refused to discuss the negative impact these agreements might have both on the economy and on democratic decision-making. \xa0\xa0</p><p class="p5">In particular, there\u2019s been no talk in government about the accelerating costs of investor-state litigation, other than the former Harper government\u2019s threat to reclaim losses\xa0from those provinces foolish enough to incur a lawsuit.\xa0</p><p class="wp-caption-text">Abitibi Bowater\u2019s hydro assets and timber and water rights for its mill on the Exploits River in Grand Falls-Windsor were taken away by the provincial government in 2008.\xa0Photo by Graham Kennedy.</p><p class="p5">There\u2019s been no talk about the chilling effect the potential for lawsuits might have on the traditional use of subsidies (in the manner of the Port Hawkesbury example) or \u2018buy local\u2019 policies (prohibited under CETA) to stimulate struggling local economies.\xa0</p><p class="p5">And there is no acknowledgement of the continuing damage investor-state lawsuits are doing to environmental protection. Apparently government doesn\u2019t think it important that Canada has already been sued five times under NAFTA\xa0for trying to protect our environment.\xa0</p><p class="p5">Why is there an unwillingness to confront these consequences?</p><p class="p3">Trade agreements are going to bring us an ever-accelerating barrage of lawsuits that will straitjacket government of our own affairs. There can be no doubt of that.

{u'full_article': u'<p>Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre wants TransCanada to "redo its homework" on the proposed Energy East pipeline before he gives his stamp of approval, after discussing the project with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p><p>The energy company is seeking to overhaul an existing natural gas pipeline and build new sections to create a 4,600-kilometre stretch that would deliver crude oil from Alberta\'s oilsands, through Montreal, to a refinery in New Brunswick.</p><p>The project aims to bring Alberta\'s oil to international markets, and would ship 1.1 million barrels of crude oil across the country a day. Alberta, which lost 19,000 jobs last year, hopes the project will boost its economy. New Brunswick is also depending on Energy East to bring in much-needed jobs and revenue.</p><p>In an appearance on CTV\'s Power Play Tuesday, Coderre said the project was "bad" from Day 1, and TransCanada has presented a poorly prepared plan.</p><p>"The heat should be on TransCanada to do their homework and be available to be part of the plan," said Coderre.</p><p>"There are many, many questions and I\'m responsible for my people."</p><p>But of late, the heat has been on Coderre to accept the pipeline.</p><p>The Montreal mayor, as well as some of his counterparts from across the province, came out last week against the project, saying concerns over environmental risks outweigh potential economic benefits.</p><p>"We have to put up a responsible, balance approach between the economy and sustainable development," Coderre said Tuesday.</p><p>"There\'s no plan B to the planet."</p><p>The announcement brought tensions to a head between Coderre and western Canadian politicians, including Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, Alberta Premier Rachel Notely and Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi.</p><p>Notely called Coderre\'s move "short-sighted," but others, such as Wall, had harsher words.</p><p>"I trust Montreal-area mayors will politely return their share of $10B in equalization supported by West," Wall tweeted.</p><p>The war of words led Trudeau to sit down with Coderre on Tuesday to discuss the issue.</p><p>"My responsibility as prime minister is to make sure that on national projects we\'re behaving in a way that contributes to the economy, to a secure environment, to bringing people together and mostly to creating a better future for future generations," said Trudeau.</p><p>Trudeau added that Ottawa will establish a review process to provide energy companies a chance to prove to municipalities that a project is in its best interest.</p><p>"The responsibility of the federal government is to establish a clear process whereby people can evaluate the projects in a rigorous and open manner," he said.</p><p>The review will also include requirements forcing energy companies to account for all greenhouse gas emissions associated with the project.</p><p>Coderre said that he has been asking Trudeau for environmental assessments on potential pipeline spills.</p><p>He said that his main concern is that the TransCanada will endanger local environments as will require 100 km of pipeline to pass through wetlands, forest and agricultural lands.</p><p>"We\'ve got to be really careful to protect our water," said Coderre.</p><p>Coderre also defended his stance by saying that he is not anti-pipeline, pointing to the city\'s eventual approval of Enbridge\'s Line 9 pipeline reversal.</p><p>"I\'m not a dogmatic. As a matter of fact, we\'ve already said yes to pipelines from Enbridge, but there are some people that have to do their job and their homework," said Coderre.</p><p>Coderre said that TransCanada has done little to allay his fears about the prevention of a spill and the potential follow-up strategy.</p><p>"It is not a blank cheque saying that, \'OK we\'re going Sera, Sera,\'" said Coderre.</p><p>"We feel for everybody but we have to do it a proper way."</p><p>Coderre also criticized the company for not participating in Montreal-area consultations on the project.</p><p>"You cannot just come like this and don\'t play in an inclusive way," he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Energy East\'s vice-president for New Brunswick and Quebec, Louis Bergeron, told The Canadian Press on Tuesday that the company plans to keep working with all the parties involved with the potential pipeline and he hopes to meet with Coderre.</p><p>Bergeron added that the company is hoping to change its approach to the project.</p><p>"I think with my background and the experience I got building one pipeline in the province of Quebec in the last few years, I know what it takes to succeed," he said. "I am right now completing my management team in Montreal and the No. 1 criteria to work for me is to be a respectful person."</p><p>Bergeron fronted the development of the 240-kilometre Pipeline Saint-Laurent, which connects Ultramar\'s refinery near Quebec City with its Montreal petroleum product distribution centre.</p><p>With files from The Canadian Press</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/rss/ctv-news-edmonton-1.822347', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/transcanada-needs-to-redo-its-homework-on-energy-east-coderre-1.2751955', u'author': u'Michael Shulman', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/transcanada-needs-to-redo-its-homework-on-energy-east-coderre-1.2751955', u'scraped_on': 1453857442, u'published_date': u'Tue, 26 Jan 2016 03:24:00 -0700', u'title': u"TransCanada needs to 'redo its homework' on Energy East: Coderre", u'_id': ObjectId('56a81aac1d41c8186fc804c1'), u'media_url': u'http://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/'}

{u'full_article': u'<p>A handful of anti-pipeline activists with lock cutters and the will to get arrested have become Canadian oil producers\u2019 newest hurdle to delivering crude to markets.</p><p>Enbridge Inc. said it was forced to shut its Line 9 from Sarnia, Ont., to Montreal for about four hours after the company\u2019s control centre detected that a valve had been tampered with and closed late on Sunday. It was the fourth time in two months that an Enbridge line was shut after a such incident. While deliveries weren\u2019t affected by the shutdowns, the company plans to enact permanent security measures at valve sites, Graham White, a company spokesman, said, declining to disclose the costs. \u201cThey have used lock cutters every time,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cIn the latest three incidents, they destroyed locks or fences, sabotaged the equipment and departed without staging a protest.\u201d</p><p>Saboteurs represent the latest hassle Western Canada faces in getting its crude to coastal markets as plans to build new pipelines are stymied by environmental and legal challenges. Pipeline development in Canada has been under increasing public scrutiny and has become a political football for local, provincial and federal leaders. Last week, Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, along with about 80 other Quebec mayors, announced his opposition to TransCanada Corp.\u2019s plans to build the Energy East line to Saint John on the Atlantic coast.</p><p>Tampering with pipelines is the latest form of opposition to moving crude oil, said Steven Paget, an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that they thought they\u2019d need to have armed guards at every pump station.\u201d</p><p>Enbridge\u2019s Line 9 provides eastern Canadian refineries with western Canadian and U.S. crude. The line went into operation last year after its direction was reversed amid opposition from local communities. In the latest incident, the Enbridge control centre detected a valve closing at 11:15 p.m. and the line was shut while it was inspected, Mr. White said. Unlike in the first two incidents, the company received no calls in advance of the action.</p><p>On Dec. 7, three protesters manually shut a valve and chained themselves to the equipment at a fenced-in site along Line 9 about 80 kilometres west of Montreal. They were removed by police. Ten days later, the line was shut again by protesters. On Jan. 4, the company\u2019s Line 7 was shut for about three hours after flow was partly restricted by protesters near Cambridge, Ont.</p><p>\u201cThe People versus Enbridge line 9\u201d group page on Facebook posted a picture of a protester breaking a chain with a lock cutter last month.</p><p>\u201cWe are taking additional permanent security measures at valve sites to help discourage such activities,\u201d Mr. White said in an e-mail. \u201cWe would not discuss details publicly since that would risk reducing the effectiveness of those measures.\u201d</p><p>Oil sands producers including Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. have clamoured for years for new pipelines to increase access to world markets, in a bid to improve the price they receive for crude. Heavy Western Canadian select is among the world\u2019s cheapest grades, selling for less than $15 (U.S.) a barrel last week.</p><p>Last year, U.S. President Barack Obama rejected TransCanada\u2019s planned Keystone XL line to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Kinder Morgan Inc. is set to face new environmental hurdles to expanding its Trans Mountain line from Alberta to tidewater at Burnaby, B.C.</p><p>New security measures to protect pipelines might include drones or cameras, Mr. Paget said. \u201cThe alternative is terrifying,\u201d he said. \u201cTurning a valve on a pipeline is like jamming the brake on a train. It poses a very high risk.\u201d</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/?service=rss', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/pipeline-saboteurs-becoming-oil-patchs-newest-foes/article28403596/', u'author': u'ROBERT TUTTLE and JEREMY VAN LOON', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/pipeline-saboteurs-becoming-oil-patchs-newest-foes/article28403596/?cmpid=rss1', u'scraped_on': 1453858042, u'published_date': u'Tue, 26 Jan 2016 17:45:27 -0500', u'title': u'Pipeline saboteurs becoming oil patch\u2019s newest foes', u'_id': ObjectId('56a81d021d41c8186fc81b14'), u'media_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/'}

{u'full_article': u'<p>Environment Commissioner Julie Gelfand speaks with the media following the release of the 2015 Fall Reports of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development in Ottawa on Tuesday Jan. 26, 2016.Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS</p><p>The \u201cHarper era\u201d for the National Energy Board \u2014 with so much focus on speeding\xa0up the\xa0regulatory review process for new oil pipelines \u2014 is quickly coming to an end in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Canada.</p><p>The idea of \u201cone project, one review\u201d conducted\xa0by the NEB within a two-year\xa0window\xa0was a key\xa0element\xa0of the omnibus Bill C-38 unveiled by then prime minister Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives in 2012 to eliminate duplication and inefficiency and deter\xa0use of the regulatory process to delay major energy\xa0developments.</p><p>It also gave cabinet the right to overrule the\xa0NEB if it rejected an application.\xa0</p><p>Harper\u2019s pipeline-backing government made it\xa0perfectly\xa0clear that \u201cstrong economic growth\u201d was the primary outcome Ottawa desired\xa0from the changes to\xa0energy regulation.</p><p>Almost four years later, the three big projects proposed to move crude for Alberta\u2019s oilsands to tidewater ports and on to global\xa0markets \u2014 Enbridge\u2019s Northern Gateway, Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain expansion and TransCanada\u2019s Energy East \u2014 are each\xa0mired in delays or controversy and remain\xa0closer to the drawing board than putting pipe in the ground.</p><p>Now concerns are\xa0emerging from Trudeau\u2019s government over the NEB\u2019s mandate and its ability to carry it\xa0out.</p><p>A report by the federal commissioner of the environment and sustainable development\xa0tabled Tuesday in the House of Commons warned the federal regulator\xa0needs to keep better track of pipeline projects just as Ottawa plans to add the impact of greenhouse gas emissions to the criteria for the NEB to determine if a project is in the public interest.</p><p>It said\xa0the NEB hasn\u2019t\xa0done enough to ensure\xa0companies are complying with conditions set out when projects are approved. Northern Gateway, for example, had 209 conditions to be met before Enbridge can\xa0proceed.\xa0</p><p>The NEB conducted 950 compliance verification activities from\xa02012 to\xa02014 and\xa0found\xa0\u201cdeficiencies in company compliance\u201d in more than one-quarter of them, the report said.\xa0The commissioner\u2019s office examined 42 of those cases of \u201cdeficiencies\u201d and determined\xa0the NEB didn\u2019t properly follow up more than half of the time.</p><p>\u201cIt is clear the Board needs to do more to keep pace with the rapidly changing context in which it operates,\u201d commissioner Julie Gelfand said in Ottawa.</p><p>Gelfand made six recommendations for\xa0tracking compliance and emergency preparedness as well as attracting and retaining staff to do the work. The board said they reflected\xa0areas the NEB had recognized as needing improvement and expects to \u201ccomprehensively\u201d address them by the end of 2016. </p><p>Trudeau promised to overhaul the NEB \u2014 he accused\xa0Harper of turning the federal regulator\xa0from a referee to a\xa0cheerleader during\xa0last year year\u2019s\xa0election campaign \u2014 and a new federal pipeline safety act is expected by June.</p><p>The NEB dates to 1959 and relocated\xa0from Ottawa to Calgary in 1991.\xa0It\xa0regulates about 73,000\xa0kilometres of interprovincial and international pipelines.</p><p>If built, the $25 billion in proposed projects would nearly double Canada\u2019s pipeline capacity by 2020. NEB\xa0chairman Peter Watson has said the regulator is at a \u201ccritical juncture\u201d given the complexity of the issues and public scrutiny and he\u2019s\xa0been implementing a \u201cmodernization\u201d plan for more than a year.</p><p>Pipelines regulated by the NEB transported oil and gas valued at more than $162 billion in 2014 but industry has said a lack of capacity\xa0led to\xa0steep discounts on Canadian crude.</p><p>Watson previously said he doesn\u2019t \u201cquibble\u201d with the need for climate debate\xa0but maintained it is\xa0up to politicians to determine if that\u2019s part of the NEB\u2019s mandate. As for staffing concerns, Gelfand isn\u2019t alone in raising the issue. The\xa0Canadian Energy Pipeline Association told\xa0a Senate committee on pipeline safety the same thing last year although\xa0widespread oilpatch layoffs may resolve that issue. </p><p>It\u2019s evident tinkering with the NEB\u2019s mandate or its operations won\u2019t satisfy the critics and even major\xa0efforts\xa0to address\xa0climate issues have done\xa0little to quiet opponents. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley introduced a carbon tax and set\xa0a 100-megatonne cap\xa0on annual GHG emissions from the oilsands in November but it\u2019s done little\xa0to quell\xa0the debate.</p><p>Notley and Trudeau have offered support for pipelines in response to criticism this week of\xa0Energy East by Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre. Trudeau said Tuesday\xa0it\u2019s\xa0\u201cthe responsibility of the federal government is to establish a clear process whereby people can evaluate the projects in a rigorous and open manner.\u201d</p><p>The response from the U.S. environmental group 350.org to a\xa0climate test for pipelines was \u201cit\u2019s\xa0time\xa0Canadian politicians stopped squabbling over this pipeline or that pipeline and woke up to the 21st century.\u201d</p><p>Politicians\xa0can empower regulators or make\xa0polluters pay \u2014 and should for a number of reasons \u2014 but there\u2019s not going to be any quid pro quo\xa0from environmentalists for those\xa0efforts. As with\xa0Harper, they don\u2019t want a rigorous\xa0review\xa0of\xa0pipelines, they simply want their way at any cost.\xa0</p><p>Either way, Canadians pay the price.</p><p>Stephen Ewart is a Calgary Herald columnist</p><p>sewart@calgaryherald.com</p><p>twitter.com/stephen_ewart</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://calgaryherald.com/feed/', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/ewart-harper-era-neb-coming-to-an-abrupt-end-under-trudeau', u'author': u'Stephen Ewart, Calgary Herald', u'original_article_url': u'http://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/ewart-harper-era-neb-coming-to-an-abrupt-end-under-trudeau', u'scraped_on': 1453896186, u'published_date': u'Wed, 27 Jan 2016 12:00:03 +0000', u'title': u'Ewart: Harper-era NEB coming to an abrupt end under Trudeau', u'_id': ObjectId('56a8b1fa1d41c8174b89d183'), u'media_url': u'http://calgaryherald.com/'}

Sign up to get it by e-mail each morning.</p><p>POLITICS BRIEFING</p><p>By Chris Hannay (@channay)</p><p>The federal government will lift sanctions and seek to normalize relations with Iran, the Liberals have announced. The news came from Foreign Affairs Minister St\xe9phane Dion yesterday in the House of Commons. It\u2019s rare that what happens in Question Period makes news, so here is that full exchange, for the record.</p><p>Tony Clement, Conservative foreign affairs critic:</p><p>\u201cMr. Speaker, it has been reported that Bombardier was trying to do business in Iran despite the fact that Canada has strict sanctions in place.</p><p>\u201cThere are legitimate reasons for these sanctions, such as threats to Israel\u2019s existence and Iran\u2019s support of terrorism.</p><p>\u201cDoes Bombardier know something that the rest of Canada does not? Has the government already lifted sanctions against Iran?\u201d</p><p>Foreign Affairs Minister St\xe9phane Dion:</p><p>\u201cMr. Speaker, it is true that the United Nations has asked the countries involved to lift the sanctions imposed under the agreement to ensure that Iran does not use nuclear capabilities for military reasons.</p><p>\u201cCanada will therefore lift these sanctions, but will continue to mistrust a regime that must not obtain nuclear weapons, poses a threat to human rights, and is not a friend of our allies, Israel in particular.</p><p>\u201cTherefore, we will comply with the United Nations\u2019 request with our eyes open.\u201d</p><p>Peter Kent, Conservative foreign affairs deputy critic:</p><p>\u201cMr. Speaker, Iran has a long history as a bad actor in the Middle East. Iran provides military assistance to the Assad regime in Syria. Iran\u2019s supreme leader routinely threatens the destruction of Israel. Reopening our Canadian mission in Tehran would put Canadian foreign service workers at risk.</p><p>\u201cWill the government abandon plans to normalize relations with Iran and keep sanctions in place?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Dion:</p><p>\u201cMr. Speaker, with the misleading approach of the former government, Canada is not in Iran. It is not good for the people of Iran, it is not good for the promotion of human rights, it is not good for our strategic interests in the region, it is not good for Israel. It is good for nobody. We will change this policy.\u201d</p><p>After Question Period, reporters asked Mr. Dion whether Bombardier would be allowed into the Iran market as soon as sanctions are lifted. \u201cIf Airbus is able to do it, why Bombardier would not be able to do it? In which way it\u2019s helping Canada or the Iranian people or Israel or anyone that Canada is hurting its own industry? Merci beaucoup,\u201d he said.</p><p>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS MORNING</p><p>&gt; Israel\u2019s ambassador to Canada, Rafael Barak, warned that Iran \u201cremains one of the most dangerous countries in the world.\u201d But \u201cthere is no justification for Canada to be standing alone after the U.S., the Europeans and others have normalized relations with Iran,\u201d John Manley, president and CEO of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, told The Globe\u2019s Robert Fife.</p><p>&gt; Veteran Middle East correspondent Patrick Martin points out relations with Iran haven\u2019t been \u201cnormal\u201d in quite some time.</p><p>&gt; A U.S. company\u2019s takeover of a Canadian telecommunications network that carries sensitive government data is raising security concerns. \u201cThe 45-day period during which the government could raise national security concerns has passed,\u201d a government spokesperson said. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains declined to explain why a national security review wasn\u2019t conducted.</p><p>&gt; A pair of National Bank economists argue the federal deficit could climb to $50-billion over two years.</p><p>&gt; Hundreds of internal investigations against RCMP officers are conducted and never made public, BuzzFeed Canada reports.</p><p>&gt; Two Ontario Liberals charged in the gas-plant scandal have court appearances today.</p><p>&gt; And Roy MacGregor takes a look at the latest skirmish in the Battle of Ottawa\u2019s LeBreton Flats.</p><p>SECUREDROP</p><p>Did you know you can share information with Globe journalists with much more security and anonymity than traditional means? Read more about SecureDrop and encrypted communication.</p><p>WHAT EVERYONE\u2019S TALKING ABOUT</p><p>\u201cCanada, Mr. Trudeau preened [in Davos], is full of bustling entrepreneurship, world-class universities, a thriving biotechnology sector, a high-technology hub \u2013 just the place for people and companies with lots of money to invest. Were that it were true, comparatively speaking. You can\u2019t knock a leader for a sales job. And you gotta love your country and all that. But Canada is not an island. It is one among many countries looking for investment. The Trudeau sales pitch notwithstanding, just where and how does Canada have a comparative advantage?\u201d \u2013 Jeffrey Simpson (for subscribers) on investing in Canada.</p><p>Andr\xe9 Picard (Globe and Mail): \u201cWhat possible justification could there be for saying that indigenous kids and their parents deserve one-third less for social services, particularly given that a) welfare payments are already pitifully low, b) social supports are more often a crying need on-reserve than off, and c) life on [reserves] is costly.\u201d (for subscribers)</p><p>Lysiane Gagnon (Globe and Mail): \u201c[For Pierre Karl P\xe9ladeau,] 2016 looks as if it is becoming another annus horribilis.\u201d</p><p>David Akin (Sun): \u201cWhile Trudeau is officially neutral on any pipeline project pending regulatory reviews, there are now enough signs to conclude that, if TransCanada does its bit and satisfies soon-to-be toughened environmental and safety regulations, the government appears ready to help create what Trudeau\u2019s inner circle calls the \u2018social licence\u2019 without which pipeline projects will not succeed.\u201d</p><p>Neil Macdonald (CBC): \u201cNo, the only possible rationale for why Ottawa spent more than $5-million trying to quash a complaint that the government of Canada was systematically discriminating against native children in providing child welfare services was because it knew there wouldn\u2019t be any uproar; the Canadian public itself just doesn\u2019t care enough about aboriginal problems.\u201d</p><p>Welcome to the Globe Politics newsletter!

{u'full_article': u'<p>There will be talking.</p><p class="story-ad"></p><p>In a joint press conference late Wednesday afternoon \u2014 after markets closed, thankyouverymuch \u2014 Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna and Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr unveiled a moderately modified evaluation process for pipeline projects already being assessed.</p><p>READ MORE: Feds announce new rules for assessing oil\xa0pipelines</p><p>Chiefly, the changes affect Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain, the twinning of an existing pipeline from Alberta to British Columbia\u2019s Lower Mainland; and TransCanada\u2019s Energy East, which would carry bitumen emulsion from Alberta\u2019s oilsands to the east coast and, if it goes forward as proposed, would be the biggest pipeline project in Canada\u2019s history.</p><p>The feds want more time to assess these projects \u2014 six months, in Trans Mountain\u2019s case. Carr and McKenna promised more consultation and a more robust evaluation of the project\u2019s impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, although it isn\u2019t clear how much weight greenhouse gas emissions will have on final decisions.</p><p>READ MORE: NEB monitoring of pipeline safety is still \u2018inadequate\u2019</p><p>But Wednesday\u2019s announcement was chiefly an interim measure, designed as a placeholder while the Liberal government hashes out a new environmental assessment process.</p><p>\u201cRight now we\u2019re in a transition period, which makes it tough,\u201d McKenna said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to proponents to make them start at the very beginning.\u201d</p><p>PIPELINE POLITICS: Oilsands and the election</p><p>WATCH: Natural Resources Minister talks about pipelines and public confidence</p><p>The federal Liberals\u2019 resource project plans have been a bit of a question mark since the election\xa0campaign.</p><p>At the time, Trudeau condemned the existing assessment process as illegitimate and failing its duty to consult with people affected and address their concerns.</p><p>\u201cIt is not for governments to be cheerleaders for various pipelines,\u201d Trudeau said in August\xa0when asked point-blank if he supports the Enbridge and Kinder Morgan\xa0pipelines.</p><p>\u201cThere is no longer a choice to be made between what\u2019s good for the economy and what\u2019s good for the environment,\u201d he said at the time, adding that his party\u2019s committed to \u201coverhauling the environmental assessment process to make sure \u2026 that Canadians\xa0worried about the scientific risks associated with specific projects are part of the solution and get their concerns heard and addressed.\u201d</p><p>WATCH: Trudeau on pipelines during the election campaign</p><p>But he and his party stopped short of specifying what their promise of new, beefed-up rules would mean for projects already in the regulatory pipeline.</p><p>\u201cWe are committed to restoring credibility to the environmental assessment process. Projects that are under review would be required to respond to this strengthened process,\u201d spokesperson Jean-Luc Ferland told Global News in an email Aug. 20.</p><p>Immediately after the election, new Burnaby North-Seymour MP Terry Beech told Burnaby Now\xa0the Trans Mountain pipeline project will have to start over.</p><p>\u201cKinder Morgan will have to go through a new, revised process,\u201d he said.</p><p>A month later, Environment Minister McKenna said the opposite: On her way to the Paris climate conference, she told reporters Trans Mountain and other projects already in the evaluation pipeline will be evaluated under the existing rules.</p><p>\u201cProjects initiated under the original system will continue on that path,\u201d she said.</p><p>This month, that changed again, when a spokesperson for Natural Resources Minister Carr told Bloomberg the government was about to unveil new, \u201ctransitional\u201d review hurdles for Trans Mountain and others.</p><p>Which brings us to Wednesday\u2019s announcement.</p><p>\u201cWe have an immediate situation that requires the immediate attention of the Government of Canada,\u201d Carr said.</p><p>\u201cWe are hopeful that Canadians will say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s better than we\u2019ve had; it\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s better than the lack of confidence we have to work with now. And it will be, probably, not quite as good as the permanent solution which will be the beneficiary of this new process.\u201d</p><p>But for all the emphasis on talk, engagement and consultation, Wednesday\u2019s announcement blindsided some of the very people whose concerns it was meant to assuage.</p><p>It was news to multiple lawyers representing B.C.\u2019s Tsleil-Waututh Nation, which has been in court as recently as last Friday arguing\xa0the feds failed in their constitutional duty to consult regarding the Trans Mountain process.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s somewhat disappointing,\u201d said Eugene Kung, a lawyer for the Tsleil-Waututh Sacred Trust Initiative.</p><p>\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t seem consistent with the rhetoric of consultation and starting a new relationship with First Nations.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s especially awkward because Crown lawyers called for a judicial detente in court last week, allowing them time to settle some of Tsleil-Waututh\u2019s concerns outside the courtroom.</p><p>Kung thinks the feds should have put ongoing pipeline projects on hold while it hashes out new environmental assessment rules.</p><p>\u201cThe process is broken and it needs fixing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI think the Liberals\xa0campaigned on doing that, on fixing it. It\u2019s unfortunate they didn\u2019t take that first very logical and pragmatic step of pausing the processes in order to fix it.\u201d</p><p>The companies affected were more circumspect.</p><p>\u201cWhile we have concerns about how this delay could impact the Project schedule, we support the principle that public confidence in the review process is crucial,\u201d Kinder Morgan said in an emailed statement.</p><p>\u201cWe need some time to evaluate what this means for Energy East in-service,\u201d TransCanada spokesperson Mark Cooper said in an email.</p><p>\u201cHowever, at this point our focus remains a 2020 in-service date.\u201d</p><p>The opposition Conservatives were unimpressed.</p><p>\u201cThe message that was set today was a terrible, terrible signal to the world that we are going to have ongoing political interference,\u201d said Tory Environment and Climate Change critic Ed Fast.</p><p>So was Greenpeace.</p><p>\u201cSimply counting the greenhouse gas emissions won\u2019t change anything,\u201d said Keith Stewart, head of Greenpeace\u2019s energy campaign.</p><p>\u201cThe key question is what kind of climate test projects have to meet in order to be considered to be in the national interest.\u201d</p><p>Lawyer Maxime Faille is particularly concerned\xa0there was no mention of the seven-fold increase in marine traffic he says would result from Trans Mountain\u2019s twinning \u2014 a significant concern to the Tslail-Waututh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\xa0encouraged to see a reference to increased consultation with aboriginal communities \u2014 that\u2019s critical.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019ll believe the rhetoric when he sees it in action.</p><p>\u201cNow, obviously, is where the rubber hits the road. We\u2019ll have to see what happens.\u201d</p><p>NDP leader Tom Mulcair accused Trudeau of backpedalling on his commitment to firm environmental regulations.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget, what Mr. Trudeau promised during the election campaign wasn\u2019t a little bit of a patchwork on top of the existing system,\u201d Mulcair told reporters Wednesday morning.</p><p>\u201cNow what he\u2019s saying is, \u2018We\u2019ll take what\u2019s already been done, but we might add a little bit of a patch on top of it.\u2019 \u2026\xa0You can\u2019t build solidly on a defective foundation.

{u'full_article': u'<p>OTTAWA \u2014 The Liberal government has added two new review mechanisms to how major new pipeline proposals are assessed. Here are some quotes on the announcement:</p><p>"We believe it is important and, in fact, essential to rebuild Canadians\' trust in our environmental assessment processes. We need to take into account the views and concerns of Canadians, respect the rights and interests of indigenous peoples and support our natural resources sector." Environment Minister Catherine McKenna.</p><p>___</p><p>"The government of Canada is free to establish its own review and its own criteria for those reviews in whatever context it chooses. And the cabinet ultimately will decide \u2014 weighing all the factors that are important to determine the national interest for these major projects." Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr.</p><p>___</p><p>"We support a strong and clear regulatory framework that helps Canadians see our commitment to building and operating oil and gas pipelines in the safest and most environmentally sound way possible. TransCanada operates in a highly regulated industry. We will continue to work with all levels of government and our regulators to ensure the continued safe and environmentally sound transportation of our natural resources to market." TransCanada spokesman Mark Cooper.</p><p>___</p><p>"While we have concerns about how this delay could impact the project schedule, we support the principle that public confidence in the review process is crucial and look forward to working with the Government of Canada on how our years of work in the area of consultation will be considered. We are confident we can demonstrate to Canadians, both the need for this Project and our commitment to building and operating this pipeline to the highest standards of environmental performance while supporting Aboriginal communities and providing lasting benefits for all Canadians." Ian Anderson, president of Kinder Morgan Canada.</p><p>___</p><p>"This is not good news for the natural resources sector. This another layer, another process." Conservative energy critic Candice Bergen.</p><p>___</p><p>"We have done our part to earn that confidence of Canadians. Now the federal government is, (through) this interim solution, attempting to have that honest conversation and ensure that voices are heard so that we can get to a decision on these matters." Alberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips.</p><p>___</p><p>\u201cWhile we welcome this attempt by the federal government to clean up the broken regulatory process left behind by the Harper government, today\u2019s announcement does little to address our longstanding concerns with the Kinder Morgan pipeline review process." Karen Campbell, Ecojustice lawyer.</p><p>___</p><p>"We are encouraged that the federal government is finally listening to the concerns of Canadians with its new transitional pipeline review process. However, it doesn\u2019t make sense that Energy East would fall under anything but a completely reformed process. As Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr acknowledged, the National Energy Board (NEB) hasn\u2019t yet deemed the Energy East application complete; the review has not begun. If the transitional process is just for projects under review, it shouldn\u2019t apply to Energy East." Adam Scott of Environmental Defence.</p><p>___</p><p>\u201cIf this new process is rigorous and the government does what it says it will do, they will come to the inevitable conclusion that the Kinder Morgan pipeline cannot be built. That is what the science says, that is what the communities say and that is what the First Nations are saying.\u201d Sven Biggs, pipeline campaigner for ForestEthics Advocacy.</p><p>___</p><p>"The truth is that the current system must be totally replaced. The National Energy Board has only been doing environmental assessments since the previous Conservative government gutted the environmental assessment process with C-38 in 2012. It is ill-suited for the role and woefully inexperienced. We need to return to the regime as it existed before the previous Conservative government took an axe to it. We need to build on what worked." Green party Leader Elizabeth May.</p><p>___</p><p>\u201cThe Trudeau government has a big job on its hands fixing pipeline reviews in this country. The recent audit of the NEB reveals deep flaws in the institution, while the board itself is dominated by individuals with a background in the fossil fuel industry. There is also the ongoing priority to reverse and then strengthen the many changes made by Harper that derailed our environmental regulations.\u201d Maude Barlow, national chairperson of the Council of Canadians.</p><p>___</p><p>\u201cIn addition to these review rules, Canada must establish a science-based climate plan that includes minimum standards on carbon pricing, and that builds upon existing provincial action. Existing provincial climate commitments will not ensure Canada meets its 2030 emissions reductions goal, and are not sufficient to ensure Canada lives up to its fair share of the Paris Agreement." Erin Flanagan, federal policy director at the Pembina Institute.</p><p>___</p><p>\u201cGreenpeace applauds Prime Minister Trudeau for taking the first steps in reforming the badly flawed environmental review process and adding an integral step to infrastructure reviews. The new rules must ensure that all energy projects are in line with Canada\u2019s commitment to doing its part to stabilize global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees. That means no new tar sands mines or pipelines." Peter Louwe of Greenpeace.</p><p>___</p><p>"Recovery of the national economy depends on getting these pipelines built but we also need to accept that this will not happen without public support. What will be critical now is everyone stepping up to the plate so we do not face further delays. Everyone involved will need to consider not just their local interest but also the national interest."

{u'full_article': u'<p>Tony Keller is editorial page editor</p><p>On Wednesday, the Trudeau government announced new rules for reviewing pipeline projects. Among them is that a pipeline\u2019s climate-change impact \u2013 will it increase production of greenhouse gases? \u2013 must be assessed when considering whether to give it the green light. At almost the same time as the government was making its announcement, the National Energy Board, which among other things is the body that reviews new pipelines, released a major report on the future of Canada\u2019s energy industry. You don\u2019t have to read far into that NEB report to find it implicitly endorsing the idea that pipelines indirectly increase greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p>According to the NEB, Canadian oil production in 2040 will be 56 per cent higher than it is now, at 6.1-million barrels a day. However, that prediction rests on the assumption that sufficient pipeline capacity will be built to move all of that oil to market. In an alternate scenario \u2013 what the NEB calls its \u201cConstrained Oil Pipeline Capacity Case,\u201d where none of the major pipelines now on the table are approved \u2013 Canadian oil production in 2040 will be markedly lower, at only 5.6-million barrels. And without new pipelines, capital expenditures in the oil patch will be \u201creduced by 15 per cent in the conventional oil sector, and by nine per cent in the oil sands.\u201d</p><p>It all comes down to Economics 101. If you want to encourage consumption of something, make it cheaper. If you want to discourage it, make it more expensive. That\u2019s why economists who want to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions believe in putting a price on carbon with carbon taxes.</p><p>Pipelines are generally the cheapest and most efficient way to move oil to market. Pipelines lower the price the producers must pay to move their oil, which means that the profit Western Canadian producers earn is higher \u2013 encouraging more oil production. And because pipelines can transport oil at lower cost than the alternatives, they make some of Western Canada\u2019s more costly and otherwise marginal oil operations economically viable.</p><p>If the three major pipelines under consideration \u2013 Enbridge\u2019s Northern Gateway, Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain expansion and TransCanada\u2019s Energy East \u2013 are never built, then the NEB\u2019s best guess is that will result in an extra half-million barrels of Canadian oil a day being priced out of the market. That oil will simply remain in the ground. If the pipelines are built, then that oil will be taken out the ground, refined and burned, with significant greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p>The NEB looked at what would happen to prices for Canada\u2019s two main Western oil benchmarks \u2013 heavy grade Western Canada Select (WCS), and the light grade known as Mixed Sweet Blend (MSW) \u2013 without new pipeline construction. The difference between the MSW price and the North American benchmark of West Texas Intermediate would widen, says the NEB, by about $5 (U.S.) per barrel. That\u2019s how much less producers would get paid for their oil. And the spread between WCS and West Texas would grow to \u201cabout $10 (U.S.) per barrel. This is the approximate extra cost that would be incurred to transport Canadian heavy crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast by rail instead of by pipeline.\u201d At those lower prices, a lot of Canadian oil production becomes uneconomic.</p><p>The bottom line? \u201cThe assumptions of the Constrained Case have implications for Canada\u2019s energy system,\u201d says the NEB. \u201cReliance on a more costly form of transportation such as rail, as well as increased competition for market share and pipeline capacity, leads to lower prices received by Canadian producers, net of transportation costs. This leads investment, crude-oil production, economic growth, energy use and GHG emissions to grow more slowly.\u201d</p><p>Now flip the previous sentences around: Reliance on a less costly form of transportation such as pipelines leads to higher prices received for Canadian producers. This leads investment, crude-oil production, economic growth, energy use and GHG emissions to grow more quickly.</p><p>How will the new, greenhouse gas-conscious, pipeline-review process deal with that fact?</p><p>The logical way to lower Canada\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions is to reduce demand for oil and other carbon-based fuels by putting a tax on them. A carbon tax would give governments a big new revenue source, which could be used to boost spending or lower other taxes. Forcing one part of the economy to be less efficient (by preventing new pipelines from being built and having oil move by more costly rail) might also raise oil prices and lower consumption. Then again, it might just shut down some Canadian production, with no effect on output in the rest of the world or consumption in Canada. (Isn\u2019t that what\u2019s happening already?)</p><p>Whatever the carbon-emissions outcome, it would result in no new revenue for government or economic benefits for Canadians. That\u2019s why reducing Canadian oil production by kneecapping pipelines as a punishment for their efficiency, rather than reducing emissions economy-wide through a tax-based carbon price, is a half-baked idea.</p><p>But many environmental groups have long wanted pipeline reviews to more fully consider their greenhouse gas consequences, and given the NEB\u2019s own conclusions, it\u2019s not hard to see why. \u201cWe applaud the Trudeau government\u2019s decision to add a \u2018climate test\u2019 to the assessment process,\u201d said Steven Guilbeault, senior director at \xc9quiterre in a press release. \u201cWe believe that this climate test will enable the government to ensure that no project gets approval if it does not meet the Paris Agreement to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\u201d</p><p>Over the coming months, as several pipeline reviews move toward the finish line, Canadians will find out exactly what this new test means, and how it\u2019s going to work.</p><p class="article__ontwitter">Follow us on Twitter: @GlobeDebate</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/?service=rss', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/yes-pipelines-increase-greenhouse-gases-will-acknowledging-it-kneecap-canadas-oil-industry/article28434293/', u'author': u'Tony Keller', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/yes-pipelines-increase-greenhouse-gases-will-acknowledging-it-kneecap-canadas-oil-industry/article28434293/?cmpid=rss1', u'scraped_on': 1454005325, u'published_date': u'Thu, 28 Jan 2016 13:06:00 -0500', u'title': u'Yes, pipelines increase greenhouse gases.

{u'full_article': u'<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, left, shakes hands with Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre following their joint press conference in Montreal, Tuesday, January 26, 2016. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes0127 biz gmo pipelinesGraham Hughes / THE CANADIAN PRESS</p><p>Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume said it best: reason is, and ought only to be, a slave to the passions.</p><p>If you\u2019ve ever tried to reason yourself into a feeling (\u201cI really ought to love Mr. X, or Wagner operas, or pickled herring\u201d), you\u2019ll know that for the vast majority of humanity it is a vain enterprise. That\u2019s because feelings don\u2019t come from reason and the mind. They come from emotions and the heart. </p><p>Hume\u2019s point was that reason doesn\u2019t tell us what to want, only how to get it. You may be surprised to learn that this matters where oil pipelines are concerned.</p><p>Ottawa has announced it intends to expand the factors regulators consider when weighing whether to approve new pipelines, such as Kinder-Morgan, Energy East and others. Henceforth the National Energy Board, for example, when considering pipelines will be called upon to assess the contribution of upstream operations to greenhouse gas emissions in addition to things such as design, safety, environmental impact and conformity with legal requirements such as consulting and accommodating affected aboriginal communities.</p><p>That\u2019s perfectly reasonable. The issue of climate change caused by human activities is a huge one and has spawned significant public opposition within Canada to our petroleum industry and to the pipeline infrastructure needed to gets its products to market. </p><p>The problem, however, is that our whole regulatory process for pipeline approval is based on reason, on a thoughtful attempt to design a process that examines objective evidence dispassionately. When that weighing of the evidence shows that pipelines meet the tests established by legislators and regulators, those pipelines are approved.</p><p>Opposition to pipelines, however, is notoriously resistant to reason and evidence. </p><p>The U.S. State Department conducted numerous environmental reviews of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline designed to bring Alberta and U.S. crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Those reviews included looking at the impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Every one of these reasoned evidence-based reviews said that KXL\u2019s impact would be negligible and that this was not a ground to refuse the presidential permit TransCanada Pipeline needed to build the project.</p><p>But the pipeline opponents didn\u2019t care about the evidence. They believed that they were eco-warriors fighting for \u201cclimate justice.\u201d President Barack Obama bowed to their unreasoning opposition to pipelines when he turned down KXL.</p><p>Here in Canada, in an attempt to mute the opposition of environmental groups to pipelines to the east and west coasts, Alberta\u2019s NDP government negotiated a deal with some of the oilpatch and several environmental groups that would cap the greenhouse gas emissions of the oilsands and raise already high environmental standards even higher. </p><p>This strategy of making reasoned process changes to win over opponents has already failed. On the West Coast, the opposition to the Kinder Morgan pipeline to Burnaby, B.C., is only getting noisier, while the federal Liberals themselves are trying to kill the Northern Gateway project indirectly by legislating an oil tanker ban in northern B.C. waters.</p><p>In Montreal all the local mayors have come out in opposition to Energy East. On the day Ottawa announced its new regulatory measures, more than 70 non-governmental organizations wrote the prime minister and premiers to oppose any new pipelines.</p><p>Toughened process requirements cannot satisfy pipeline opponents or even cause them to be less vociferous in their attacks because they believe that any process that approves pipelines is itself vicious and flawed and they are willing to toss democracy, the rule of law and balanced treatment of conflicting interests on the trash heap to achieve their aims.</p><p>At some point our politicians are going to confront the hard truth that there are no process fixes that will satisfy pipeline opponents; they believe pipelines are bad and the approval process a weapon to be commandeered in the struggle against them. There is no compromise that will win their assent. Then our leaders will have to make choices about whose side they\u2019re on. It won\u2019t be pretty. </p><p>Brian Lee Crowley (twitter.com/brianleecrowley) is the Managing Director of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, an independent non-partisan public policy think tank in Ottawa: www.macdonaldlaurier.ca.</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://ottawacitizen.com/feed/', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/crowley-pipeline-opposition-emotional-not-reasoned', u'author': u'Tyler Dawson, Ottawa Citizen', u'original_article_url': u'http://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/crowley-pipeline-opposition-emotional-not-reasoned', u'scraped_on': 1454079874, u'published_date': u'Fri, 29 Jan 2016 14:58:23 +0000', u'title': u'Crowley: Pipeline opposition emotional, not reasoned', u'_id': ObjectId('56ab7f841d41c810d8570a4f'), u'media_url': u'http://ottawacitizen.com/'}

Yet, the NEB is now considering whether TransCanada Pipeline Corporation\u2019s submission on their proposed Energy East pipeline is complete. NEB is the regulator!</p><p>Simultaneously we hear that TransCanada has made some 700 changes to its original submission on Energy East, which has resulted in $3 billion additional costs. Apparently, according to their CEO, Russ Girling, TCC is \u201clistening and acting\u201d on what they have heard from concerned citizens.</p><p>But, conspicuously absent from those 700 changes is anything to say that the old section of Energy East pipe from Saskatchewan to Cornwall, Ont., won\u2019t simply be converted \u2014 rather than be laid as new pipe. This, of course, is the section of pipe which has leaked and exploded some 12 times through our region in as many years. TCC is the corporation!</p><p>Meanwhile, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne has given support to Alberta Premier Rachel Notley in her quest to \u201cget product to market.\u201d This is after the Ontario Energy Board last year concluded that the risks of Energy East outweighed the benefits.

These are probably the same people who think the Flintstones is a documentary," he said.</p>&#13;<p>Coderre, a former Liberal MP, was echoing a comment made by Liberal strategist Warren Kinsella in 2000 against then-Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day.</p>&#13;<p>A day after Coderre and fellow Montreal-area mayors came out swinging against Energy East and the Alberta government\'s pipeline strategy came under fire, Premier Rachel Notley received some welcome support from Ontario\'s premier.</p>&#13;<p>In a joint news conference in Toronto on Friday, Kathleen Wynne praised Notley for the NDP government\'s climate change plan and gave at least tentative backing to the $15.7-billion Energy East pipeline, which would move Alberta oilsands crude to the east coast for export.</p>&#13;<p>The Liberal premier said Alberta\'s efforts "makes the national conversation about climate targets and pipelines easier."</p>&#13;<p>"We appreciate that there is a need for a way to get Canadian oil, that is allowed under Alberta\u2019s new emission cap, to overseas markets. And the people of Ontario care a great deal about the national economy and the potential jobs that this proposed pipeline project could create in our province and across the country,\u201d said Wynne.</p>&#13;<p>Coderre\'s announcement that municipalities in the city\'s metropolitan area were opposed to Energy East prompted\xa0a flurry of criticism from Alberta and western Canadian politicians aimed at Coderre, with the NDP government describing his attitude as "both ungenerous and short-sighted."</p>&#13;<p>But Notley also faced criticism, with the Wildrose leader saying Montreal\'s rejection showed that the NDP plan to gain social licence for pipeline through tougher environmental policies had failed.</p>&#13;<p>The NDP climate plan released last fall calls for the implementation of a broad-based carbon tax in 2017, an oilsand emissions cap, the accelerated phase-out of coal and a sharp reduction in methane emissions.</p>&#13;<p>At the news conference, Notley repeated the criticism of Coderre as short-sighted and touted the pan-Canadian economic benefits of Energy East, which is being pushed forward by Calgary-based TransCanada Corp.</p>&#13;<p>"This pipeline is part of building a strong Canada, it\'s part of building a strong economy," she said.</p>&#13;<p>"And let me just say, a pipeline is the safest way, the most efficient way (to ship oil) ... that is the safe solution."</p>&#13;<p>\xa0</p>&#13;&#13;&#13;&#13;<p class="ga-bottom" id="ga-bottom-main"></p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.calgarysun.com/news/alberta/rss.xml', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.calgarysun.com/2016/01/22/denis-coderre-brian-jean-among-those-who-think-the-flintstones-is-a-documenary', u'author': u'None', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.calgarysun.com/2016/01/22/denis-coderre-brian-jean-among-those-who-think-the-flintstones-is-a-documenary', u'scraped_on': 1453823329, u'published_date': u'Fri, 22 Jan 2016 15:36:07 MST', u'title': u"Denis Coderre: Brian Jean among those 'who think the Flintstones is a documentary'", u'_id': ObjectId('56a795661d41c87ba5c9a682'), u'media_url': u'http://www.calgarysun.com/'}
{u'full_article': u'<p>The National Energy Board has serious problems in its effort to ensure the safety of pipelines, the federal environment commissioner says \u2013 a finding that will provide more fuel for the country\u2019s heated debate over two proposed multibillion-dollar projects.</p><p>In an audit released Tuesday, the commissioner, Julie Gelfand, said the Calgary-based federal regulator did not adequately track the implementation of conditions that the board itself required in approving pipelines, nor did it consistently follow up on deficiencies in companies\u2019 overall regulatory compliance.</p><p>With the proposed expansion of oil-and-gas pipeline capacity, \u201cit is clear that the National Energy Board needs to do more to keep pace with the rapidly changing context in which it is operating,\u201d Ms. Gelfand said in a statement.</p><p>The environment commissioner also found fault with the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, saying it has been issuing conditional approvals for controversial pesticides and leaving them on the market despite evidence of environmental damage.</p><p>Her report comes amid growing East-West tensions over the proposed Energy East project, and continued opposition in British Columbia to the expansion of the TransMountain pipeline that carries crude from Alberta to Vancouver.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met Tuesday with Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, who \u2013 along with his area colleagues \u2013 precipitated a cross-Canada political storm last week over their opposition to TransCanada Corp.\u2019s Energy East project. That proposed $15.7-billion pipeline would carry 1.1-million barrels a day of crude through the Montreal area to eastern refineries and export terminals.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau has pledged to strengthen the environmental approvals process, which critics complain became a rubber stamp under the previous Conservative government. The government plans to subject the two proposed pipelines to an assessment of how they would impact greenhouse-gas emissions in the upstream oil sector in Alberta, sources told The Globe and Mail Monday.</p><p>The environment commissioner \u2013 part of the Office of the Auditor General \u2013 released a report five years ago that found serious shortcomings in the National Energy Board\u2019s oversight of pipeline safety. In its report Tuesday, it said the NEB had addressed many of those concerns, but that significant gaps remain.</p><p>The auditors found that in half of the 49 pipeline approvals they examined, the NEB did not adequately track whether companies satisfied the conditions set by the board, while there were \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in 22 of 42 cases in which the board was dealing with regulatory non-compliance for existing operations.</p><p>\u201cThis is important because pipeline approval conditions and regulatory requirements exist so that pipelines can be built and operated safely,\u201d the audit report said.</p><p>It also found the NEB was having trouble recruiting and retaining the staff needed to meet its regulatory mandate.</p><p>The audit urged the board to strengthen its risk-assessment and emergency-management planning. For example, a third of companies\u2019 emergency procedural manuals \u2013 which are reviewed by the board \u2013 lacked necessary documentation.</p><p>Together with the proposed Northern Gateway project, the megaprojects approved or under consideration would double the country\u2019s oil transportation capacity, with proposed investment totalling more than $25-billion.</p><p>The Harper government approved the Northern Gateway project, with 209 conditions imposed by the NEB. Enbridge Inc. is still working to meet those, though the Liberal government vows to ban tanker traffic in the area, a move which would effectively kill the project. If approved, the TransMountain or Energy East project would also face scores of conditions to ensure the work was done properly.</p><p>In its response contained in the audit report, the NEB agreed with the auditor\u2019s conclusions. It said it does assess whether companies meet approval conditions but will document its work more rigorously. It said it is working to strengthen its compliance effort and will \u201cclarify the consequences for companies that do not undertake corrective action\u201d within the required time frame.</p><p>On pesticides, the auditor concluded that the federal regulatory agency has fallen short of its mandate of \u201cpreventing unacceptable risks to the health of Canadians and the environment from the use of pesticides.\u201d</p><p>At issue is its practice of issuing conditional registration for prolonged periods; such registrations are granted when risks are deemed acceptable but more information is required. Eight of nine products that have been conditionally registered for more than a decade are neonicotinoids which, the auditors noted, are now widely in use in Canada and are suspected of being a threat to bees, other pollinators and broader ecosystems.</p><p>Last week, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency announced it would no longer issue conditional registration, effective June 1.</p><p class="article__ontwitter">Follow Shawn McCarthy on Twitter: @smccarthy55</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/?service=rss', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/federal-watchdog-hits-national-energy-board-on-scrutiny-of-pipeline-safety/article28392658/', u'author': u'Shawn McCarthy', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/federal-watchdog-hits-national-energy-board-on-scrutiny-of-pipeline-safety/article28392658/?cmpid=rss1', u'scraped_on': 1453823406, u'published_date': u'Tue, 26 Jan 2016 10:16:32 -0500', u'title': u'Federal watchdog hits National Energy Board on scrutiny of pipeline safety', u'_id': ObjectId('56a795b01d41c87ba5c9ac46'), u'media_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/'}

Value goes down, therefore taxes must go up. The numbers he quotes are nonsense. My house increased in value, only because it can be replaced by an infill, by 10% last year. My taxes went up close to 30%. Why does he not simply come out and say the city needs an \u201cX\u201d amount of money and it will get it because it just simply can. I am sure that signing contracts with the civic unions well above the inflation rate and economic situation contributed to the appetite by the city for higher taxes. Mayor Spendshi still argues we have lower property taxes than many other municipalities. I suppose he does not have to worry about reading his bills, otherwise he would be aware many fees, such as garbage and recycling, are not listed in property taxes but come out on the utility bills. Added to the property taxes, the picture is not really in favour of Calgary. But that is obviously not his concern. As it shapes out the mayor and the council will go down in the city\u2019s history as the most expensive elected body.</p>&#13;<p>Zdenek Kutac</p>&#13;<p>(Life isn\u2019t cheap and average Calgarians are getting it from all sides.)</p>&#13;<p>\xa0</p>&#13;<p>TWO CANADAS</p>&#13;<p>In reply to the letter from Mike Roebuck: I do agree 110% with your comment, however it does not go far enough. Look at the map of Canada and you will soon see that there is very little we in the west have in common with the east. The west believes in criminal justice, the east believes in hug-a-thug sentencing. The west believes in less government in our lives, the east wants more. The west believes in prudent fiscal management (that is arguable in Alberta right now) whereas the east lives for huge deficits and paying off their friends. After all, the Liberals are entitled to their entitlements. From the first days of confederation, the west have been the cash cow for the east. From the wheat board raping western farmers to the \u201980s NEP and now the new NEP (called a carbon tax). It\u2019s sad really to hear our PM make comments like \u201cCanada belongs to Quebec.\u201d Or his father giving the west the middle finger or the national news media commenting that the Conservatives should learn from their mistake and never again elect a leader from the west.

As if wait times aren\u2019t long enough now for medical treatment, just wait until 25,000 more get into the system. These refugees should have been housed in a refugee camp in Turkey or some other Middle Eastern country until such time as the situation is stabilized, they could then be resettled in their own country.

There is no secret Obama is not a fan of Canada unless he gets his own way. Wasting everyone\u2019s time and spending millions of Canadian dollars doing it, he should be held accountable. The NAFTA agreement is always under fire by the Americans trying to re-negotiate after the fact in their favour. I wish Canada had a government that had a strong front to the Americans. The Conservatives were not great showing strength against U.S. policies but Liberals and now NDP provincially are 10 times worse. Neither Trudeau or Notley have leadership capabilities in running any government. I would like to see a leader like Brad Wall, premier of Saskatchewan, run federally, be it any party. He seems to have a good grasp of the issues and promotes Canada\u2019s energy industry. Our current leaders fail miserably at understanding the energy industry or representing the country or province. Governments are not run on taxes alone but need industry for healthy growth and prosperity. Canada is badly in need of leaders.

Environment Minister Shannon Phillips is quoted in the article by Bob Weber of the Canadian Press: \u201cI\u2019m not sure that anybody likes $35 a barrel (West Texas Intermediate). Or a $6-billion deficit due to a drop in royalties. Or a spike in domestic violence rates. Or a spike in food bank usage. Or a spike in suicide rates. Or charitable donations being down. I\u2019m not sure that anyone\u2019s actually comfortable with that. And that\u2019s what relying on one commodity to one market at one price delivers to us ...\u201d I never made the connection that we were contributing to domestic violence, food bank usage and even suicide by using those evil fossil fuels. Perhaps the environment minister can explain how she made these connections.</p>&#13;<p>CLIFFORD JONES</p>&#13;<p>(Don\u2019t question our new NDP overlords. They clearly know what is best for us.)</p>&#13;<p>\xa0</p>&#13;<p>FEELING ABANDONED</p>&#13;<p>Loved your letter, Mike Roebuck, but unfortunately Alberta is exempt from any protection under the Canadian Constitution as evidenced by Ottawa\u2019s abuse of us in 1905, 1930, 1980 and now the transfer payments (just to name a few abuses). When Ottawa has stolen our last penny and Alberta is broke with no money, no industries, no jobs and of no further financial use to Eastern Canada, Ottawa has the power to toss us out of Confederation, and why not? If Ottawa and the rest of Canada felt no obligation to save Albertans from mass starvation in the 1930s (we were forced to borrow from the U.S. to save our people\u2019s lives), why would they feel any responsibility to support Alberta once we become a \u201cThird World\u201d province?</p>&#13;<p>Dean Pearce</p>&#13;<p>(We don\u2019t like to be abused but think you are being overly dramatic.)</p>&#13;<p>\xa0</p>&#13;<p>TAX HEADACHE</p>&#13;<p>I just received my tax bill and it\u2019s going up close to $510. This is due to the fact I rebuilt in the inner city nine years ago, instead of forcing the city to build new roads/facilities in the boonies. Council refused to increase fees for transit this year (though they increase spending on routes/LRT), but they found they needed money and spent from the city budget surplus.How can this be done? I thought a few things were policy: 1. Transit has to pay 40%+ of its operating budget, not using extra tax money bequeathed to it. 2. If we give them an extra $15 million to use one year, where is the $15 million coming from in the future to break even, let alone cover increase costs? 3. Freezing transit only helps those currently working, those laid off don\u2019t benefit as they wouldn\u2019t likely be buying passes. 4. If there are fewer people working in the core, should we not be able to cut bus service going there as rider count will also go down? My wife left an oilpatch job and now makes 30% of the salary working with kids. We aren\u2019t made of money. How can my property value have gone up from last year from $1,000,000 to $1,040,000, yet revenue neutral has my taxes go up from $5,755 to $6,053 (I know new communities have been built), this is almost a 5% increase (again I must be subsidizing someone) before the continual beating I take at your annual increase? Why hasn\u2019t the city learned fiscal constraint, I\u2019m sure a good independent audit would point out many issues or places where controls weren\u2019t in place. With the city\u2019s BTC increase of 3.5%, my taxes goes up even more to $6,264, this makes it almost a 10% increase from year to year.Yes I built inner city (my fault when I could have built in the suburbs and had the city subsidize me) but then there is a surplus of my prior year taxes and instead of giving me back $100-$200, you give it to transit and come back to the trough for more. Council continues to discriminate against those that spend more on a home.</p>&#13;<p>Robert Roney</p>&#13;<p>(What\u2019s that old chestnut about not being able to fight city hall?)</p>&#13;<p>\xa0</p>&#13;<p>NEIGHBOUR DANGER</p>&#13;<p>For the safety of all, if we witness peculiar, dangerous, or radical behaviour, we are encouraged by our government to say something. So, here goes. I think my neighbours may be terrorists. They are displaying many of the telltale signs. They are stockpiling guns and ammunition at an alarming rate. They somehow manage to bring religion into every political conversation. They are seemingly unfazed by the mass slaughter of their own countrymen, women and children. And, they adhere to the beliefs of leaders who consistently fan the flames of hatred and racism. Their behaviour has changed rapidly for the worse as of late, and the lack of any kind of barrier separating our two properties has me worried. We used to have a lot in common and would frequently go back and forth to spend time with each other, but our ever-growing difference of opinion has me thinking we\u2019re better off making friends with the neighbours down the street. So, U.S.A., it\u2019s time to speak up and rat you out. Your irrational and radical behaviour is disturbing, and frankly, terrifying. I hope you will understand and get back to the way you used to be. Until then, perhaps this will encourage you to get the help you sorely need.

The NAFTA agreement isalways under fire by the Americans trying to re-negotiate after the factin their favour. I wish Canada had a government that had a strong frontto the Americans. The Conservatives were not great showing strengthagainst U.S. policies but Liberals and now NDP provincially are 10 timesworse. Neither Trudeau or Notley have leadership capabilities inrunning any government. I would like to see a leader like Brad Wall,premier of Saskatchewan, run federally, be it any party. He seems tohave a good grasp of the issues and promotes Canada\u2019s energy industry.Our current leaders fail miserably at understanding the energy industryor representing the country or province.

Look at the map of Canada and you will soon see that there is very little we in the West have in common with the East. The West believes in criminal justice, the East believes in hug-a-thug sentencing. The West believes in less government in our lives, the East wants more. The West believes in prudent fiscal management (that is arguable in Alberta right now) whereas the East lives for huge deficits and paying off their friends. After all, the Liberals are entitled to their entitlements. From the first days of Confederation, the West have been the cash cow for the East. From the wheat board raping western farmers to the \u201980s NEP and now the new NEP (called a carbon tax). It\u2019s sad really to hear our PM make comments like \u201cCanada belongs to Quebec.\u201d Or his father giving the West the middle finger or the national news media commenting that the Conservatives should learn from their mistake and never again elect a leader from the West.

Lee Hayes and his coworker Dave Stuart have a blunt assessment of U.S. President Barack Obama\'s rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline: "It sucks." The two 50-something men make their living maintaining equipment in the tiny, quiet town of Hardisty, Alta., where oilsands crude was to have begun its journey along Keystone XL.Jeff McIntosh / THE CANADIAN PRESS</p><p>The National Energy Board is doing an \u201cinadequate\u201d job of tracking the petroleum sector\u2019s compliance with pipeline approval conditions and significant problems remain in the regulator\u2019s reviews of companies\u2019 emergency procedures, Canada\u2019s environment commissioner says in a new report.</p><p>The Calgary-based NEB also has failed to improve public access to information on how companies are complying with conditions attached to pipeline approvals, while the board struggles with recruiting and retaining specialists in pipeline safety and regulatory compliance, Environment and Sustainable Development Commissioner Julie Gelfand says in her report released Tuesday.</p><p>A review of the NEB\u2019s oversight of federally regulated pipelines found several instances where the board isn\u2019t adequately fulfilling its duties, at the same time as $25 billion worth of pipeline megaprojects \u2013 such as Energy East, Trans Mountain expansion and Northern Gateway \u2013 have been approved or are under review by the regulator, the report says.</p><p>Federal Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development Julie Gelfand.Ottawa Citizen</p><p>\u201cOur audit concluded that the Board did not adequately track companies\u2019 implementation of pipeline approval conditions, and that it was not consistently following up on company deficiencies. We found that the Board\u2019s tracking systems were outdated and inefficient,\u201d Gelfand said.</p><p>\u201cWith the anticipated increase of pipeline capacity and the coming into force of the Pipeline Safety Act by June 2016 (which gives the NEB new powers on emergency response), it is clear that the National Energy Board needs to do more to keep pace with the rapidly changing context in which it is operating.\u201d</p><p>The problems identified at the NEB come at a critical time for pipeline construction and energy development in Canada.</p><p>Just last week, Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre and 81 other mayors from surrounding municipalities came out in opposition to TransCanada\u2019s $15.7-billion Energy East pipeline, which would ship oilsands crude from northern Alberta to Quebec and on to New Brunswick.</p><p>They argued there was minimal economic gain for their region and unacceptable environmental risk. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met Coderre on Tuesday morning to discuss the matter.</p>Related<p>Trudeau and the Liberal government have promised to introduce a new environmental assessment process for energy projects that has more teeth.</p><p>They also pledged in their platform to \u201cmodernize the National Energy Board\u201d to ensure it better reflects regional views, and has \u201csufficient expertise\u201d in areas like environmental science and community development.</p><p>The environment commissioner\u2019s audit found the NEB\u2019s tracking and documentation of pipeline approval conditions was adequate for about half (25 of 49) of the cases examined between 2000 and 2014.</p><p>But in the remaining 24 cases, the board\u2019s tracking was inaccurate or out of date, key documentation was missing, or the files lacked a final analysis and conclusion of whether the conditions had been fully satisfied, the report says.</p><p>In one case, the NEB didn\u2019t demonstrate that it has properly assessed or received all the required reports from a company on the employment, training and economic opportunities for aboriginal groups during the construction phase.</p><p>In another case, the commissioner\u2019s office found the NEB didn\u2019t track company compliance with a condition that required the firm to file a study examining the environmental effects of a possible pipeline rupture. The pipeline ran close to caribou habitat.</p><p>\u201cBoard records did not indicate whether this condition was satisfied, despite more than 10 years passing,\u201d the report says.</p><p>In another area, the environment commissioner\u2019s office found the NEB has improved its follow-up on company non-compliance, but that \u201cgaps remain.\u201d</p><p>In 22 of 42 cases examined by the environment commissioner, the NEB\u2019s follow-up was either inconsistent or improperly documented, the report says.</p><p>\u201cCompliance tracking information was out of date or inaccurate, the timeliness of the Board\u2019s follow-up varied, or the Board\u2019s analysis or conclusion on company compliance was missing,\u201d the report says.</p><p>Between 2012 and 2014, the National Energy Board conducted about 950 compliance verification activities, of which more than one-quarter (252 of 950) \u201cidentified deficiencies in company compliance.\u201d</p><p>The environment commissioner\u2019s office examined 42 of the 252 compliance deficiencies and found the NEB did not consistently or properly follow-up on compliance verification in more than half of the cases where there were issues (22 of the 42 cases examined).</p><p>The NEB faced \u201csignificant, system-wide challenges with the information management tools it used to track company compliance,\u201d the report says.</p><p>On emergency preparedness, the audit found the NEB faces \u201cimportant areas for improvement\u201d in fulfilling its role as the lead federal agency in pipeline emergency response.</p><p>The board has improved its review of company emergency procedures manuals, but one-third of them still need to be updated, the report says.</p><p>These emergency procedure manuals outline how each company will respond in the event of an emergency, such as a pipeline rupture.</p><p>\u201cThe Board must ensure that these manuals are complete and up to date, so that, in the event of an emergency, the relevant company has a clear response plan to follow,\u201d the report says.</p><p>The new Pipeline Safety Act that will come into force no later than June 2016 gives the NEB additional responsibilities in this area, including powers to take over emergency response in certain circumstances.</p><p>Compounding some of the problems is that the NEB is struggling to recruit and retain staff, particularly in the areas of safety and engineering.</p><p>The NEB expects the retirement rate in areas of safety and engineering could total about 25 per cent over the next five years.</p><p>\u201cThe Board identified these resource constraints as factors that could limit its ability to perform all its compliance verification and monitoring activities,\u201d the report says.</p><p>The environment commissioner made six recommendations to the NEB related to tracking company compliance, emergency preparedness, and attracting and retaining staff.

They have been since 1874, when Ulysses S. Grant held the first foreign state dinner for the king of Hawaii, a sovereign oceanic state the U.S. was already engulfing. Only those who matter to the Americans get invited.</p>&#13;<p>Trudeau, at this stage, is more selfie than statesman, so it\'s not his diplomatic skills Obama wants. More likely, it\'s one liberal leader wanting to introduce another to those he hopes will succeed him.</p>&#13;<p>Still, there\'s no shortage of issues that need attention between Ottawa and Washington: a fragile economy, global trade, the energy sector, the war against ISIS, among them.</p>&#13;<p>On many files, our interests don\'t intersect, a point underlined this week as Canadian energy giant TransCanada filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration for rejecting its proposed Keystone XL oilsands pipeline to the Gulf Coast.</p>&#13;<p>Make no mistake, this should be a long overdue working meal.</p>&#13;<p>Bon appetit.</p>&#13;<p>-- Postmedia Network</p><p class="clearfix ads-container"></p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.lfpress.com/opinion/editorial/rss.xml', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.lfpress.com/2016/01/07/state-dinner-chatter-should-be-interesting', u'author': u'None', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.lfpress.com/2016/01/07/state-dinner-chatter-should-be-interesting', u'scraped_on': 1453823446, u'published_date': u'Thu, 07 Jan 2016 19:08:35 EST', u'title': u'State dinner chatter should be interesting', u'_id': ObjectId('56a795da1d41c87ba5c9b11b'), u'media_url': u'http://www.lfpress.com/'}

{u'full_article': u'<p class="articlerelatedphotogallery section"></p><p class="articlerelatedvideogallery section"></p><p itemprop="articleBody">In the wake of British Columbia\u2019s recent announcement that it cannot support Kinder Morgan\u2019s proposed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, conservative pundits and oil companies are turning their sights to TransCanada\u2019s Energy East pipeline and tanker proposal. But there\u2019s no reason to believe that Energy East \u2014 the last pipe plan standing \u2014 will get built.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">By opposing Kinder Morgan, B.C. Premier Christy Clark has shown that her priority is protecting the best interests of the people of B.C. Ontario should learn from this.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">B.C.\u2019s opposition to the proposal was based on five conditions, ranging from spill response to First Nations consultation, to guaranteeing economic benefits for the people of B.C. Kinder Morgan failed to meet these conditions, especially when it came to putting in place a \u201cworld class\u201d spill prevention system and emergency response plan.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Oil companies and politicians are now shifting their focus to the last mega-pipeline proposal on the table \u2014 Energy East. But its prospects look even worse than Kinder Morgan\u2019s.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">On Thursday Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, on behalf of 82 Montreal-area mayors, voiced official opposition to the proposal. After an extensive review and public consultation, Montreal municipal leaders said the potential risks outweigh any possible economic benefits to communities. The review showed that the project could have unacceptable social, economic, environmental and public security impacts.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Like B.C. Premier Clark and the Montreal mayors, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard set out clear conditions that Energy East would need to meet in order to win the province\u2019s approval. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne did the same thing back in 2014 \u2014 even though on Friday she ignored that Energy East fails to meet any of the reasonable conditions her own government put in place to safeguard Ontario residents. And it doesn\u2019t look as though TransCanada will be able to meet those conditions.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Among the criteria is the need for world-class contingency plans and an emergency response program. But the Ontario Energy Board, in its review of Energy East, decried that emergency response plans were either inadequate or not available. Guaranteeing the safety of Energy East is no small feat given that the pipeline would traverse the entire breadth of Ontario and much of Quebec while crossing nearly 1,000 rivers and lakes. Add to this that much of the proposed Energy East route wasn\u2019t built to carry tarsands oil but lower-pressure natural gas. An oil pipeline would never have been allowed so close to so many bodies of water.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">There are serious concerns around what happens when the pipeline inevitably leaks, especially after the U.S. National Academy of Sciences released a landmark study just last month that shows pipelines carrying tarsands oil (diluted bitumen) need special spill response measures that don\u2019t yet exist.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Especially damning is the Ontario Energy Board\u2019s top-line finding: the environmental risks of Energy East outweigh the potential benefits to Ontarians. The board found that economic benefits projected for the province may have been over-estimated, and \u201cany claims about substantial GDP growth and job creation in Ontario from pipeline construction should be viewed critically.\u201d </p><p itemprop="articleBody">Another unfulfilled provincial condition: properly consult with First Nations, which the Chiefs of Ontario have already formally noted. This is a serious matter. The B.C. Supreme Court just found in favour of the Coastal First Nations challenging the Northern Gateway pipeline project on exactly this \u2014 lack of proper consultation.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">There\u2019s also the public: the majority of Ontarians oppose Energy East. And for good reason, Lake Temagami, Lake Superior and the Ottawa River are no less deserving of protection than the Great Bear Rainforest.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">On top of all this, the federal government has promised a new, meaningful review process for all energy projects. The National Energy Board hasn\u2019t started to review the Energy East proposal, so it should be put through this new, strengthened process.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">All this suggests that Energy East\u2019s fate will be much like that of Kinder Morgan: the Ontario government must oppose the pipeline, just like the B.C. government said no to the Trans Mountain project. Based on recent history, this is the most likely outcome.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It\u2019s time to let go of the pipe dream and instead speed up Canada\u2019s transition to a modern, clean energy economy.

{u'full_article': u'<p>Dear reader, I owe you an apology. I\'ve been writing this column on sustainability for nearly two years now and I\'ve yet to define what sustainability means, exactly.</p><p>A close friend who\'s evidently not a regular reader of mine told me how interesting he found a recent column. But he quickly - if a little sheepishly - added that "sustainability" seems to be a bit of a buzz word that gets used in a number of different ways, not all of them reconcilable.</p><p>He\'s not wrong. Not entirely, anyway.</p><p>For one, lots of folks whose actions appear utterly unsustainable proudly bandy the word about.</p><p>Take TransCanada Pipelines, the company behind the Keystone XL and Energy East oil pipeline projects. It might surprise you to learn that TransCanada was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 12th consecutive year in 2013. The Dow Jones sustainability index purports to measure the stock performance of the world\'s leading companies in terms of economic, environmental and social criteria.</p><p>According to estimates prepared by the Pembina Institute, the crude production needed to fill the Energy East pipeline would generate an additional 30 to 32 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year - the equivalent of adding more than seven million cars to Canada\'s roads (pembina.org/pub/2519). How can a company proposing such a project be lauded as "sustainable"?</p><p>Or take our federal government, which also happens to be TransCanada\'s biggest cheerleader. In 2008, the Harper government simultaneously passed and then erased from its memory the Federal Sustainable Development Act, my favourite law.</p><p>Why\'s it my favourite? Section 5 of the Act proclaims that "[t]he Government of Canada accepts the basic principle that sustainable development is based on an ecologically efficient use of natural, social and economic resources and acknowledges the need to integrate environmental, economic and social factors in the making of all decisions by government."</p><p>How great would Canada be if the government integrated environmental, economic and social factors when making policy decisions?</p><p>But I digress. The point I really want to make is this: Just because some misuse and abuse the term, sustainability is still a useful concept.</p><p>The term was first defined in 1987 in what is known as the Brundtland Report, which defined "sustainable development" as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."</p><p>OK, you say, that\'s a start, but that definition seems to raise as many questions as it answers. What are our "needs," exactly? And what will be the "needs" of future generations, who can\'t yet even speak for themselves? How do we sort this out?</p><p>There\'s certainly no shortage of proposals at the moment. In fact, we seem to have entered a new phase in environmental law and policy. I call it the manifesto phase, because it seems like there\'s a new manifesto released every other week proclaiming a solution to the sustainability riddle.</p><p>Last month, for example, over 70 Canadian researchers released Acting on Climate Change: Solutions from Canadian Scholars, which I\'ve already discussed in a couple of recent columns (www.sustainablecanadadialogues.ca/en/endorsement).</p><p>Not to be outdone, another Canadian group, which styles itself as Canada\'s Ecofiscal Commission, released a report earlier this month called The Way Forward: A Practical Approach to Reducing Canada\'s Greenhouse Gas Emissions (www.ecofiscal.ca/wayforward/).</p><p>At the same time, yet another manifesto - An Ecomodernist Manifesto (www.ecomodernism.org/) - seeks to liven things up by outright rejecting the ostensibly responsible idea that we have to harmonize with nature to avoid economic and ecological collapse, which, to be fair, would certainly put a damper on things.</p><p>Instead, the authors of the Ecomodernist Manifesto argue that "[i]ntensifying many human activities - particularly farming, energy extraction, forestry, and settlement - so that they use less land and interfere less with the natural world is the key to decoupling human development from environmental impacts. These socioeconomic and technological processes are central to economic modernization and environmental protection. Together they allow people to mitigate climate change, to spare nature, and to alleviate global poverty."</p><p>And coming soon, just in time for the summer blockbuster season, is Pope Francis\' highly anticipated encyclical on climate change, which will follow from the conference being held later this month in the Vatican City entitled Protect the Earth, Dignify Humanity: The Moral Dimensions of Climate Change and Sustainable Development (www.endslavery.va/content/endslavery/en/events/protect.html).</p><p>Of all the recent sustainability manifestos I\'ve cited, the Pope\'s encyclical may be the most important. More than any of the others, the Pope\'s encyclical is expected to highlight the social dimensions of sustainability, including the moral responsibility of everyone - world leaders, corporations and ordinary citizens alike - to become involved in imagining what exactly a sustainable future might look like.</p><p>Jason MacLean teaches environmental law at Lakehead University and writes here biweekly.</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/search/?c%5B%5D=opinion%2Fcolumns%2Fjason_maclean%2A&d=&d1=&d2=&f=rss&l=25&q=&s=start_time&sd=desc&t=article', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/opinion/columns/jason_maclean/what-is-sustainability-anyway/article_9655a2f2-e77e-11e4-97ae-6ffaa69af070.html', u'author': u'SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS by Jason MacLean', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/opinion/columns/jason_maclean/what-is-sustainability-anyway/article_9655a2f2-e77e-11e4-97ae-6ffaa69af070.html', u'scraped_on': 1453823259, u'published_date': u'Mon, 20 Apr 2015 08:00:00 -0400', u'title': u'What is sustainability, anyway?', u'_id': ObjectId('56a7951b1d41c87ba5c9a072'), u'media_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/'}

{u'full_article': u'<p>CALGARY \u2014 Alberta Premier Rachel Notley has said she wants the discussion over pipelines to be "drama free," but this week it was anything but.</p><p>A coalition of Montreal-area mayors came out against the $15.7-billion Energy East Pipeline on Thursday, setting off a bout of cross-Canada sniping between municipal and provincial politicians over a matter that falls within federal jurisdiction.</p><p>Notley said it was "short-sighted" for the Montreal Metropolitan Community to oppose Energy East on the grounds its risks outweigh its economic benefit.</p><p>Other Western politicians had harsher words.</p><p>"I trust Montreal-area mayors will politely return their share of $10B in equalization supported by West," Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall tweeted.</p><p>Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre retorted with the respective populations of metropolitan Montreal versus Saskatchewan: four million compared to 1.13 million.</p><p>Meanwhile, Brian Jean, head of Alberta\'s Opposition Wildrose party, blasted Coderre for allowing raw sewage to be dumped into the St. Lawrence River, but opposing Energy East on environmental grounds.</p><p>Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi made a similar point at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland: "I could make a joke about how well Montreal protects that particular waterway over the last several months, but I won\'t."</p><p>"I\'ve got a lot of respect for Mayor Coderre. On this, however, he\'s wrong," said Nenshi. "Certainly he needs to hold out for a better deal for himself... that\'s what mayors tend to do. But the deal has to be within reach."</p><p>The tone between Notley and her Ontario counterpart was much more congenial at a news conference Friday.</p><p>Premier Kathleen Wynne praised the climate change initiatives of Alberta\'s NDP government, saying those efforts are making "the national conversation about climate targets and pipelines easier."</p><p>Many of Ontario\'s conditions for supporting the pipeline are starting to be addressed, Wynne added.</p><p>Energy East, proposed by Calgary-based TransCanada Corp. (TSX:TRP), would take up to 1.1 million barrels a day of Alberta crude as far east as an Irving Oil refinery and export terminal in Saint John, N.B.</p><p>In Davos, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau encouraged everyone to work together.</p><p>"I\'m very much in the camp of both premiers Wynne and Notley, who demonstrated that Canada can and should work together on eco issues for all of us. That\'s the focus that I\'ve always taken \u2014 collaborating, respectful, working together to solve the challenges that are facing all Canadians."</p><p>Trevor McLeod, director of the centre for natural resources policy at the Canada West Foundation, said the sub-national pipeline spat is frustrating to watch when there are bigger issues to deal with \u2014 like the U.S. going from Canada\'s biggest customer to its biggest competitor.</p><p>"There\'s big stuff going on right now and we\'re playing this parochial game in Canada about who gets what," he said. "Are we a country or not? If you can\'t get product through the other provinces to global markets, I don\'t think we can sustain this notion that we\'re going to be a trading nation."</p><p>The debate over pipelines has become the "trickiest national unity issue in Canada" over the past five years or so, said Sean Kheraj, a York University historian focused on Canada\'s approach to energy and the environment.</p><p>Similar East-versus-West quarrels have erupted in the past. But the lines of division have flipped.</p><p>Amid the 1970s oil shocks, Ottawa wanted a pipeline to send western crude east to ensure a steady supply of crude and offered subsidies to Interprovincial Pipe Lines, the forerunner of Enbridge Inc. (TSX:ENB), to get it done. Alberta opposed the move because producers could sell oil for a higher price to the Americans than domestically.</p><p>The prime minister at the time \u2014 Pierre Trudeau, the father of the current prime minister \u2014 took a much more hands-on approach to energy issues, said Kheraj.</p><p>"That\'s the irony. In the 1970s, Interprovincial got dragged kicking and screaming into building this pipeline to Montreal and today we\'ve got TransCanada, Kinder Morgan and Enbridge banging down the door trying to get these pipelines built."</p><p>Mount Royal University political scientist Keith Brownsey said Ottawa has the power to declare Energy East a "national project" and approve it over local objections.</p><p>But whether the Liberal government chooses to do so is another matter.</p><p>"I think there will be a reluctance on the part of Mr. Trudeau \u2014 as there was on the part of Mr. Harper \u2014 to make those decisions."</p><p>Follow @LaurenKrugel on Twitter.</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/search/?c%5B%5D=news%2Fnational%2Cnews%2Fnational%2F%2A&d=&d1=&d2=&f=rss&l=100&nsa=eedition&q=&s=start_time&sd=desc&t=article', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/news/national/debate-over-pipelines-anything-but-drama-free-as-energy-east/article_e5fbcaa6-bf4f-5edf-80bb-ac896e32492c.html', u'author': u'Lauren Krugel The Canadian Press', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/news/national/debate-over-pipelines-anything-but-drama-free-as-energy-east/article_e5fbcaa6-bf4f-5edf-80bb-ac896e32492c.html', u'scraped_on': 1453833291, u'published_date': u'Fri, 22 Jan 2016 17:36:27 -0500', u'title': u"Debate over pipelines anything but 'drama free' as Energy East debate heats up", u'_id': ObjectId('56a7bc4f1d41c804c420e7d5'), u'media_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/'}

{u'full_article': u'<p>CALGARY \u2014 Pipeline proposals just can\'t catch a break these days.</p><p>The latest hurdle came this week when an organization representing 82 Montreal-area municipalities came out against TransCanada Corp.\'s Energy East Pipeline, drawing a sharp rebuke from politicians in Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p><p>Here is an update on the status of other major Canadian pipeline projects:</p><p>Keystone XL:</p><p>TransCanada, the same company behind Energy East, applied for U.S. permission to build its Keystone XL pipeline in September 2008. The idea was to expand an existing cross-border pipeline to give oilsands crude a more direct route to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.</p><p>At the time, TransCanada thought XL would proceed through the regulatory process just as smoothly as the previous Keystone phases. It was wrong.</p><p>The stretch of pipe cutting a diagonal line from the Saskatchewan-Montana border to southern Nebraska became the focal point of the U.S. environmental movement and a political lightning rod in Washington.</p><p>Debate over Keystone XL centred not only on the environmental effects on the American Heartland in the event of a spill, but on its broader role in climate change. Stop pipelines, the environmental groups argued, and you stop the development of carbon-intensive oilsands crude.</p><p>After a seven-year regulatory saga, U.S. President Barack Obama rejected Keystone XL in November \u2014 weeks before United Nations climate change talks in Paris.</p><p>TransCanada set in motion a US$15-billion challenge under the North American Free Trade Agreement arguing it was treated inequitably. It has also launched a separate federal lawsuit seeking a declaration that Obama overstepped his constitutional power when he rejected Keystone XL.</p><p>TransCanada maintains it has not given up on Keystone XL.</p><p>Northern Gateway:</p><p>Enbridge\'s Northern Gateway pipeline would ship 525,000 barrels a day of oilsands crude from northeast of Edmonton to Kitimat, B.C. Its goal is to sell Alberta crude in lucrative Asian markets. A parallel line would bring 193,000 barrels a day of bitumen-thinning diluent in the opposite direction.</p><p>Northern Gateway has been hugely controversial. The idea of crude-oil laden supertankers navigating the choppy waters of the Douglas Channel on their way out to the Pacific is a non-starter for many British Columbians. The line also passes through huge tracts of unceded First Nations territory in British Columbia. Though Enbridge has signed agreements with many First Nations along the route, many \u2014 especially on the coast \u2014 are staunchly opposed.</p><p>Enbridge has had a federal permit to build Northern Gateway since mid-2014, but recent developments have caused critics to declare Northern Gateway "dead in the water."</p><p>The federal Liberal government has signalled it intends to formalize a tanker ban on B.C.\'s north coast.</p><p>A recent B.C. Supreme Court ruling found the province did not properly consult First Nations over an agreement to cede decision-making power over Northern Gateway to the federal National Energy Board. The ruling essentially forces B.C. to make its own decision on Gateway \u2014 with aboriginal input. Observers say that decision could have implications for another controversial B.C. crude project, Kinder Morgan\'s Trans Mountain expansion.</p><p>Enbridge says it\'s still committed to the project, though it\'s in no hurry to make an official go-ahead decision.</p><p>The company is working to "re-engage" with First Nations and work out an updated cost estimate. The joint review panel\'s report in late 2013 pegged the cost at $7.9 billion.</p><p>Trans Mountain:</p><p>The Canadian arm of U.S. energy giant Kinder Morgan is aiming to nearly triple the capacity of its Trans Mountain pipeline to 890,000 barrels of oil a day. The existing Trans Mountain line currently ships 300,000 barrels a day of various petroleum products from the Edmonton area to the B.C. Lower Mainland and Washington state.</p><p>The project is in the thick of the NEB review process. It has faced stiff opposition from those who do not want to see more crude-filled tankers moving through the Burrard Inlet, including Lower Mainland mayors. The B.C. government has said it doesn\'t support the project because it doesn\'t meet its five conditions for crude pipelines.</p><p>Kinder Morgan filed its regulatory application for the Trans Mountain expansion in late 2013. The National Energy Board hearing process for Trans Mountain has been highly criticized. Opponents have called on Ottawa to halt that review \u2014 and the one into Energy East \u2014 while the NEB process is revamped.</p><p>Though the official cost estimate for the project remains $5.4 billion, Kinder Morgan Canada\'s president said it\'s looking like it will be higher because of currency swings, delays and design changes.</p><p>Follow @LaurenKrugel on Twitter.</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/search/?c%5B%5D=news%2Fnational%2Cnews%2Fnational%2F%2A&d=&d1=&d2=&f=rss&l=100&nsa=eedition&q=&s=start_time&sd=desc&t=article', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/news/national/state-of-play-a-look-at-the-status-of-pipeline/article_10e05416-195a-59c1-b1ab-d6f6ba37fe67.html', u'author': u'Lauren Krugel The Canadian Press', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/news/national/state-of-play-a-look-at-the-status-of-pipeline/article_10e05416-195a-59c1-b1ab-d6f6ba37fe67.html', u'scraped_on': 1453833291, u'published_date': u'Fri, 22 Jan 2016 13:26:06 -0500', u'title': u'State of play: A look at the status of pipeline projects in Canada', u'_id': ObjectId('56a7bc4f1d41c804c420e7eb'), u'media_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/'}

{u'full_article': u'<p>The Liberal plan to instill confidence in environmental assessments for pipeline megaprojects was panned Thursday by several First Nations groups as well as the mayor of Burnaby, B.C., who accused the federal government of being captured by the oil industry.</p><p>In a joint statement, First Nations leaders from B.C., Manitoba and Quebec slammed as \u201cmodest\u201d the reforms to the resource projects review process announced by the Liberal government, saying Ottawa needs be prepared \u201cto take no for an answer\u201d from indigenous communities with regard to major pipelines that will cross their traditional territory.</p><p>Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr and Environment Minister Catherine McKenna pledged Wednesday to conduct extensive consultations with indigenous communities before deciding whether to approve Kinder Morgan Inc.\u2019s proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline to Vancouver or TransCanada\u2019s planned Energy East line from Alberta to New Brunswick.</p><p>They also said the government would assess the impact such projects would have on greenhouse gas emissions in the oil sector, though Ms. McKenna said such a review would be one of many factors going into cabinet decisions.</p><p>In a telephone interview, Burnaby Mayor Derek Corrigan said he was \u201cseverely disappointed\u201d in the measures, noting that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had promised during the election campaign to overhaul the environmental review process and force Kinder Morgan to resubmit its expansion proposal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear the oil company lobbyists and the lobbyists for the pipelines have gotten to the Liberals very quickly, and suddenly we\u2019re hearing a very different tune from ministers and from the Prime Minister,\u201d said Mr. Corrigan, whose community lies at the terminus of the Kinder Morgan line. \u201cDuring the election, it was \u2018re-start the process, the public has no faith\u2019 \u2026 and now we\u2019re hearing a desperation to get this oil to the shore.\u201d</p><p>In a release Thursday, the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, and the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs said the new measures \u2013 which include an assessment of projects\u2019 impacts on greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 fall well short of what is needed to instill confidence among aboriginal people.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we were not consulted about the planned reforms because we could have signalled ahead of time that such reforms did not go nearly far enough,\u201d Regional Chief Ghislain Picard, of the Quebec and Labrador assembly, said in a statement.</p><p>In announcing the additional measures, the Liberal ministers said Ottawa needed to restore public trust in the project review process to win social licence for new pipelines, which the Alberta government and industry insist are critical to the province\u2019s economic well-being. They said the new rules would add four months for a decision on the Kinder Morgan project, now with a December deadline; they lengthened the Energy East project by nine months to the fall of 2018.</p><p>Conservative critics accuse the Liberals of failing the Western oil-producing provinces and resource industry workers by imposing new delays and maintaining a neutral stand on the need for new pipelines. Company spokesmen said they worried about the delays imposed by the new rules, but hoped they would help generate broader public support for their projects.</p><p>First Nations leaders are essentially demanding a veto over resource projects that pose environmental risks to their traditional territory. In their statement Thursday, the aboriginal leaders said the current National Energy Board review process is deeply flawed, with a lack of cross-examination of companies\u2019 evidence, artificial timelines and the exclusion of key evidence.</p><p>\u201cIn regard to the threats that are represented by heavy-oil pipelines proposals, the inherent risks to the environment \u2013 to the rivers, streams and eco-systems \u2013 are just so great that sometimes No is the only answer,\u201d Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, said in an interview.</p><p>Asked what his message was to Albertans and other Canadians who rely on the industry for their livelihood, Chief Phillip said: \u201cThey have to wake up and smell the coffee \u2026</p><p>\u201cThis is at the point in the history of this planet that we need to undertake that paradigm shift to other forms of energy \u2013 solar power, wind power and other means. We can\u2019t just simply continue this obsession with such developments as the tar sands,\u201d he said.</p><p>Alberta Environment Minister Shannon Phillips welcomed the federal measures, saying they would help bolster public confidence. And she said critics should take into account the NDP government\u2019s actions to impose carbon pricing, a cap on oil-sands emissions and measures to ensure the industry operates responsibly.</p><p>\u201cIt is a new day with respect to the environmental responsibilities that Alberta has taken on its energy development,\u201d she said in an interview.</p><p class="article__ontwitter">Follow Shawn McCarthy on Twitter: @smccarthy55</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/?service=rss', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/first-nations-groups-slam-liberal-reforms-to-pipeline-reviews/article28448048/', u'author': u'SHAWN McCARTHY', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/first-nations-groups-slam-liberal-reforms-to-pipeline-reviews/article28448048/?cmpid=rss1', u'scraped_on': 1454031560, u'published_date': u'Thu, 28 Jan 2016 20:22:20 -0500', u'title': u'First Nations groups slam Liberal reforms to pipeline reviews', u'_id': ObjectId('56aac2ca1d41c86d1546a826'), u'media_url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/'}

It makes sense.\u201d\xa0The mayor will head to Ottawa after wrapping up at the Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association (SUMA) convention in Regina this week.\xa0Fougere said he wasn\u2019t surprised to hear the premier\u2019s announcement Tuesday that the province will run a deficit. He said the promise that revenue sharing will remain the same is foundational. He said he took it as a good sign that the premier said the issue of deficits should be short-term.\xa0\u201cIt\u2019s just indicative of our economy flattening out, but notwithstanding that, the fundamentals of our economy are much stronger than we\u2019ll say Alberta\u2019s,\u201d Fougere said.\xa0He said for the short-term, a deficit is a much better way to handle the problem of revenue shortfalls than raising taxes.</p>Join the Discussion<p>News Talk 980 CJME is happy to provide a forum for commenting and discussion.

{u'full_article': u'<p>Infrastructure projects and the Energy East pipeline were on the agenda as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mayor Denis Coderre met Tuesday morning in Montreal.</p><p>It was a meeting planned before a spat erupted between the provinces over the pipeline project, the two say.</p><p>Coderre has been roundly criticized since coming out in opposition to Energy East last week. He is the president of the Montreal Metropolitan Community, which represents 82 Montreal-area municipalities and cities. The group rejected the project, saying the risks of an environmental disaster outweigh any potential benefits the project may bring.</p><p>Coderre said the project is worth about $2 million a year in economic benefits to the Montreal area, while the cleanup of a major oil spill could cost between $1 billion and $10 billion.</p><p>When asked whether he would try to convince the group to change the group\'s opinion, Trudeau dodged the question saying the federal government\u2019s role in the matter is to put in place a process whereby TransCanada, in this case, can demonstrate a project is in the public interest.</p><p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do \u2026 is establish a clear process that will look at greenhouse gas emissions, build on work that\u2019s already been done and give Canadians \u2013 the different levels of government, scientists, Aboriginal people \u2013 the chance to make their opinions heard and participate in the decision-making process, he said.</p><p>"You can\'t build a strong economy without protecting environment at same time. It\'s not one or the other," he said.</p><p>Trudeau went on to crticize the role the Harper government played in the process, saying they acted like "cheerleaders" instead of "responsible referees" for the process.</p><p>Coderre spoke about striking a balanced approach between economic and sustainable development.</p><p>"We said yes to Enbridge [the Line 9B pipeline reversal project] because they\'ve done their homework, so we need to have the environmental impact [reports], we need to understand because there\'s no plan B for the planet," he said.</p><p>The criticisms of Coderre and the group of municipal leaders came from politicians in Saskatchewan and Alberta. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley called the Montreal-area leaders\u2019 decision \u201cshort-sighted,\u201d while Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall tweeted Quebec should return the equalization payments it receives.</p><p>The meeting occurred hours before the federal environment commissioner released the results of an audit which shows the National Energy Board is failing to enforce pipeline approval conditions or follow up on compliance problems.</p><p>Coderre and Trudeau also spoke about infrastructure projects, including light rain and prolonging the metro\'s blue line, as well as the effort in welcoming refugees.</p><p>-- with files from The Canadian Press</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/rss/ctv-news-montreal-1.822366', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/energy-east-pipeline-trudeau-says-ottawa-s-role-is-to-facilitate-talks-1.2752067', u'author': u'None', u'original_article_url': u'http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/energy-east-pipeline-trudeau-says-ottawa-s-role-is-to-facilitate-talks-1.2752067', u'scraped_on': 1453823114, u'published_date': u'Tue, 26 Jan 2016 07:41:00 -0500', u'title': u"Energy East pipeline: Trudeau says Ottawa's role is to facilitate talks", u'_id': ObjectId('56a7948a1d41c87ba5c99703'), u'media_url': u'http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/'}

{u'full_article': u'<p>Stock markets began\xa0the week with a thud, as major equity indexes in Toronto and New York registered hefty losses Monday alongside\xa0another sharp drop\xa0in oil prices.</p><p>By the close, Toronto\u2019s lead index was off 246 points or nearly two per cent to close at 12,143. Energy stocks led to\xa0the downside, falling over five per cent, as U.S. light crude prices shed almost $2 US a barrel to close at $30.34 in New York.\xa0</p><p>Oil\xa0continued to slide in after-hours trading, slipping below $30 US. On the flip side, gold stocks rose\xa0as bullion prices registered another uptick.</p><p>In New York, all three major indexes wound up deep in\xa0the red, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding 208 points, the S&amp;P 500 Index down almost 30 points and the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slipping almost 73 points.</p><p>Monday\u2019s pullback\xa0followed a sharp\xa0shortcovering\xa0rally Friday,\xa0as stocks and oil prices rebounded from\xa0Wednesday\u2019s lows, when the S&amp;P 500 bottomed out at\xa0just\xa01,812, 15 per cent below\xa0its record\xa0high.</p><p>But\xa0the lack of follow-through Monday confirms that the bears remain in charge, pointing to\xa0more downside ahead. With billions of dollars exiting U.S. stock funds in recent weeks,\xa0investors are trimming their exposure to riskier assets following\xa0the worst\xa0start\xa0to a new year in stock market history.</p><p>Many now expect the major U.S. indexes to fall into a full-fledged bear market \u2014 defined as\xa0a\xa0decline of at least 20 per cent from their 2015 peak levels \u2014 before the washout is complete.\xa0That could take a couple more\xa0months.</p><p>As of Monday\u2019s close, the Dow has dropped\xa013.4\xa0per cent from its\xa0record\xa0high of 18,351 reached last May, while the S&amp;P 500 is 12\xa0per cent below its May peak\xa0of 2,134. The Nasdaq Composite Index has given up\xa013.6\xa0per cent since it reached a peak of\xa05,231 last July.</p><p>To plunge into\xa0bear market territory, the Dow would have to fall to 14,650 \u2014 1,235\xa0points or 7.7 per cent below Monday\u2019s close \u2014 and the S&amp;P 500 would have to shed a further\xa0172\xa0points or 9.1 per cent to 1,705.</p><p>Toronto\u2019s benchmark S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index is already in bear market territory. Canada\u2019s resource-heavy market\xa0has shed about 22.4\xa0per cent since hitting its record high of\xa015,657 in September 2014. But it\u2019s hardly alone.</p><p>Many other markets, including\xa0Russia, Japan, Germany, France, Hong Kong and Brazil, have also tumbled into bear market territory. If the U.S. follows suits, it\xa0would be the last big domino to fall.</p><p>Despite the fireworks in the stock market, the U.S. economy continues to chug along, and most economists see the odds of a U.S. recession at less than 25 per cent. The decoupling of the market and the economy has surprised many investors, but it shouldn\u2019t. Bear markets can and do sometimes occur in periods of economic growth.</p><p>As for the never-ending decline in oil prices, the wall of worry only seems to grow higher with each passing week. Last week, the threat of new supplies from Iran was the big focus. On Monday, the focus turned to war-torn Iraq, which reported record oil output\xa0of more than 4.1 million barrels per day in December.\xa0</p><p>While\xa0Alberta\u2019s landlocked crude still can\u2019t reach world markets, due to vocal opposition to pipelines in provinces\xa0such as\xa0Quebec and British Columbia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Russia and other oil-producing nations are happily filling the gap.</p><p>\u201cLook at the amount of Iraqi oil now coming to the U.S. Gulf Coast,\u201d says Robert Johnston, CEO of New York-based Eurasia Group, a consulting firm that\xa0tracks global oil markets and political risks on behalf of major investors.</p><p>\u201cThose are heavy oil barrels, much like Canada\u2019s diluted bitumen. That shouldn\u2019t really happen. Iraqi oil should go to China and Canadian oil\xa0should go to the U.S.\xa0It\u2019s sort of\xa0a\xa0strange world.\u201d</p><p>Indeed it is. Canada was once considered a politically stable country that was attractive to foreign investors. But that is changing, says Johnston.</p><p>The virulent opposition in Quebec to\xa0TransCanada\u2019s proposed Energy East pipeline and equally vocal opposition in B.C. to the\xa0proposed\xa0expansion of the\xa0TransMountain pipeline to\xa0Burnaby, B.C., has global investors reassessing the appeal of\xa0investing in Canada, notwithstanding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s sales pitch at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p><p>\u201cThere is a view that Canada\xa0does have some political risk now,\u201d Johnston told the Alberta Industrial Heartland Association\u2019s annual gathering\xa0last week. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of risk we see in Nigeria or Iraq or Russia. It\u2019s more on the policy, regulatory, or environmental side. But those can be equally challenging (risks) for\xa0business.\u201d</p><p>glamphier@postmedia.com</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://edmontonjournal.com/feed/', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-stocks-oil-prices-fall-as-canadian-investment-risks-rise', u'author': u'Gary Lamphier, Edmonton Journal', u'original_article_url': u'http://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-stocks-oil-prices-fall-as-canadian-investment-risks-rise', u'scraped_on': 1453823134, u'published_date': u'Tue, 26 Jan 2016 14:26:45 +0000', u'title': u'Gary Lamphier: Stocks, oil prices fall as Canadian investment risks rise', u'_id': ObjectId('56a7949e1d41c87ba5c997be'), u'media_url': u'http://edmontonjournal.com/'}

Closer to home, the National Energy Board is now considering documents filed by TransCanada Corp. for the proposed Energy East pipeline, a pipeline that would run just north of Thunder Bay. Neither of these projects will consider greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Both of these proposed pipelines would facilitate the expansion of the Alberta Tar Sands, an expansion that is completely incompatible with Canada reaching reasonable greenhouse gas emissions targets .</p><p>Thunder Bay has already experienced what climate change can bring \u2014 from Lyme disease to a suffering moose population to extraordinary flooding.</p><p>As a country, we are also suffering the impacts from allowing a single-resource industry to define our economic well-being.</p><p>We also understand that the economic opportunities presented by a shift to renewable energy are massive, from well-paid clean-tech jobs to healthier cities and people.

{u'full_article': u'<p>Melissa Lachance of Montreal looks at a map of the proposed Energy East pipeline, at a rally organized by Greenpeace and other groups at Jack Layton Park in Hudson on July 4, 2015.Frederic Hore / Montreal Gazette</p><p>From Quebec\u2019s enviro-nationalists to Alberta\u2019s old energy apologists, few are tackling the issue of TransCanada\u2019s contentious Energy East pipeline with any semblance of balance. Some are even exacerbating what has now become a minor national unity crisis.</p><p>When the autopsy of this messy debate is conducted it will find at least three men responsible: Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall and the CBC\u2019s Rick Mercer. So consumed with their narrow interests, the politicians seem to have forgotten that Canada remains a federation, not a collection of fiefdoms, while the ranting comedian reduces Canada\u2019s complex equalization system to a series of transactions between east and west.</p><p>\u201cWe all need this thing,\u201d Mercer said, clever as always, but failing to demonstrate that we truly need this one particular oil pipeline as a magic bullet to rescue Canada\u2019s sluggish economy. Mercer\u2019s Qu\xe9b\xe9cois counterpart, Jean-Ren\xe9 \u201cInfoman\u201d Dufort, joined a chorus of parody videos pointing out that receiving equalization payments doesn\u2019t mean Quebec should \u201cferme sa gueule\u201d and embrace new pipelines as British Columbia and the United States reject them.</p><p>While asymmetrical federalism can have its drawbacks, Wall expressed on social media last week that he would seemingly prefer a form of random-federalism, where an oil-empowered western premier acts as if he has the authority to hang federal equalization dollars over the heads of Quebecers.</p><p>\u201cI trust Montreal-area mayors will politely return their share of $10-billion in equalization supported by west(ern provinces),\u201d Wall quipped, to which Parti Qu\xe9b\xe9cois MNA Jean-Fran\xe7ois Lis\xe9e replied, \u201cI trust the West will refund the $10-billion of Quebec taxes spent on big oil tax breaks and grants over the years.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a childish debate for Wall to ignite; one that fails to consider the purpose of federal governments. The Saskatchewan premier should know that pitting regions against each other fuels sovereignist hysteria and is counterproductive for the 100,000 workers who lost their jobs last year as a result of the downturn in the energy sector.</p><p>\u201cSay thank you,\u201d Coderre then tweeted, waving those same federal dollars over the heads of Saskatchewanians while Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose warned that Coderre\u2019s rhetoric \u201cisn\u2019t in the spirit of national unity\u201d (neither was Wall\u2019s).</p><p>The Rest of Canada\u2019s position is seen as paternalistic by some commentators in Quebec. \u201cColonialist schemes\u201d are forcing Quebecers into a position of \u201cconstant submission,\u201d wrote sovereignist penseur Mathieu Bock-C\xf4t\xe9. Apparently eager to capitalize on Western missteps, Quebecor colleague Jos\xe9e Legault even compared the Energy East spat to the failure of the Meech Lake constitutional reforms (wishful thinking)!</p><p>I trust Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has reminded his provincial and municipal counterparts that, on a handful of federal files like Energy East, it simply isn\u2019t the prerogative of regions to set the tone of the debate. There is no need for such firmly entrenched stances on either side when the National Energy Board and Quebec\u2019s Bureau d\u2019audiences publiques sur l\u2019environnement have yet to complete their work.</p><p>Communication on the issue has been so muddled that a source close to the industry mused to me that \u201cthe biggest question most journalists have is whether the pipelines will be underground or above ground.\u201d (Energy East would be underground, even under the St. Lawrence River, which presents fewer environmental risks than transport over an overloaded rail system.) If journalists are so confused about the Energy East plan, the public at large is surely disconnected from the debate (making polls on the issue largely irrelevant).</p><p>The pipeline is a private endeavour that is TransCanada\u2019s, not Wall\u2019s, to sell to Canadians. It may be seen as necessary, but it is not free of risk and is certainly not an example of sustainable development.</p><p>While regional considerations should be just that, considerations, a final Energy East decision should be based on sound science resulting from rigorous consultation and evaluation; not what\u2019s best for Coderre\u2019s fiefdom or Wall\u2019s. Conservative panic over a struggling oil industry, however, has backfired and placed TransCanada in a more disadvantageous position as the prime minister, among his considerations, now must consider growing discontent among Quebec nationalists.</p><p>Dan Delmar is an independent public relations consultant at Provocateur Communications and the host of The Exchange, Mondays and Wednesdays at 8-10 p.m. on CJAD 800 Montreal.</p><p>twitter.com/DanDelmar</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://montrealgazette.com/feed/', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/dan-delmar-denis-coderre-brad-wall-and-rick-mercers-pipeline-polemics-ill-serve-canada', u'author': u'Edie Austin, Montreal Gazette', u'original_article_url': u'http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/dan-delmar-denis-coderre-brad-wall-and-rick-mercers-pipeline-polemics-ill-serve-canada', u'scraped_on': 1454095062, u'published_date': u'Fri, 29 Jan 2016 19:11:10 +0000', u'title': u"Dan Delmar: Denis Coderre, Brad Wall and Rick Mercer's pipeline polemics ill serve Canada", u'_id': ObjectId('56abbad81d41c81c13aa9b4b'), u'media_url': u'http://montrealgazette.com/'}

{u'full_article': u'<p>Scottish philosopher David Hume said it best: reason is, and ought only to be, a slave to the passions.</p><p>If you\u2019ve ever tried to reason yourself into a feeling (\u201cI really ought to love Mr. X, or Wagner operas, or pickled herring\u201d), you\u2019ll know that for the vast majority of humanity, it is a vain enterprise. That\u2019s because feelings don\u2019t come from reason and the mind. They come from emotions and the heart.</p><p>Hume\u2019s point was that reason doesn\u2019t tell us what to want, only how to get it. You may be surprised to learn that this matters where oil pipelines are concerned.</p><p>Ottawa has announced it intends to expand the factors regulators consider when weighing whether to approve new pipelines, such as Kinder Morgan, Energy East and others. Henceforth, the National Energy Board, for example, when considering pipelines, will be called upon to assess the contribution of upstream operations to greenhouse gas emissions, in addition to things such as design, safety, environmental impact and conformity with legal requirements such as consulting and accommodating affected aboriginal communities.</p><p>That\u2019s perfectly reasonable. The issue of climate change caused by human activities is a huge one and has spawned significant public opposition within Canada to our petroleum industry and to the pipeline infrastructure needed to gets its products to market.</p><p>The problem, however, is that our whole regulatory process for pipeline approval is based on reason, on a thoughtful attempt to design a process that examines objective evidence dispassionately. When that weighing of the evidence shows that pipelines meet the tests established by legislators and regulators, those pipelines are approved.</p><p>Opposition to pipelines, however, is notoriously resistant to reason and evidence.</p><p>The U.S. State Department conducted numerous environmental reviews of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline designed to bring Alberta and U.S. crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Those reviews included looking at the impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Every one of these reasoned evidence-based reviews said that KXL\u2019s impact would be negligible and that this was not a ground to refuse the presidential permit that TransCanada needed to build the project.</p><p>But the pipeline opponents didn\u2019t care about the evidence. They believed that they were eco-warriors fighting for \u201cclimate justice.\u201d President Barack Obama bowed to their unreasoning opposition to pipelines when he turned down KXL.</p><p>Here in Canada, in an attempt to mute the opposition of environmental groups to pipelines to the east and west coasts, Alberta\u2019s NDP government negotiated a deal with some of the oilpatch and several environmental groups that would cap the greenhouse gas emissions of the oilsands and raise already high environmental standards even higher.</p><p>This strategy of making reasoned process changes to win over opponents has already failed. On the West Coast, the opposition to the Kinder Morgan pipeline to Burnaby, B.C., is only getting noisier, while the federal Liberals themselves are trying to kill the Northern Gateway project indirectly by legislating an oil tanker ban in northern B.C. waters.</p><p>In Montreal, all the local mayors have come out in opposition to Energy East. On the day Ottawa announced its new regulatory measures, more than 70 non-governmental organizations wrote the prime minister and premiers to oppose any new pipelines.</p><p>Toughened process requirements cannot satisfy pipeline opponents, or even cause them to be less vociferous in their attacks, because they believe that any process that approves pipelines is itself vicious and flawed and they are willing to toss democracy, the rule of law and balanced treatment of conflicting interests on the trash heap to achieve their aims.</p><p>At some point, our politicians are going to confront the hard truth that there are no process fixes that will satisfy pipeline opponents\xa0\u2014\xa0they believe pipelines are bad and the approval process a weapon to be commandeered in the struggle against them. There is no compromise that will win their assent. Then our leaders will have to make choices about whose side they\u2019re on.

He\u2019s worried that adding more consultations with indigenous people and the public separate from the NEB review could add months if not years to the process.</p><p>However, as the Conservative Harper government learned after accusing critics of the Northern Gateway Pipeline of being radicals and enemies of the state, and changing environmental and fisheries laws to facilitate construction across more than a thousand rivers and streams and a couple of mountain ranges, an official stamp of approval doesn\u2019t exactly translate into a project going ahead.</p><p>Even though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals may not have got everything right with the interim review process for Kinder Morgan\u2019s Trans Mountain and TransCanada\u2019s Energy East pipeline projects, the revamped process has the potential to get more buy-in from pragmatic ordinary Canadians even if the environmental activists insist that all oil must remain in the ground.</p><p>The requirements for meaningful consultations with First Nations, assessing the climate impact of upstream greenhouse gas emissions, consideration of the views of Canadians in affected communities, and basing decisions on science, traditional knowledge of first people and other evidence all lend credibility to the review process and shore up public confidence that the process isn\u2019t rigged to accommodate the energy companies.</p><p>This doesn\u2019t mean Montreal or Vancouver area residents, for instance, get a veto, but that their concerns will be considered and addressed as much as possible. Certainly, it will add time to the approval process.

As Saskatchewan Trade Minister Jeremy Harrison put it on Thursday, \u201cIt would appear that the Government of Canada is going to be putting hurdles in front of the energy sector, and the pipeline industry particularly, that don\u2019t exist for other industries.\u201d</p><p>So if both sides of the political spectrum are angry at you, this must mean that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and company are spot on with their\xa0new environmental assessment process and regulatory regime for energy projects, right?</p><p>No, not by a long shot.</p><p>Trudeau needed to grab this issue away from local, vote-grubbing B.C. and/or Quebec municipal politicians and\xa0the more radical element of the environmental movement that will never be satisfied until the \u201ctarsands\u201d and entire fossil fuel industry is shut down.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.

Clearly, this week\u2019s report from Canada\u2019s\xa0environmental watchdog that suggested the NEB didn\u2019t track pipeline companies to ensure they were complying\xa0with terms set out for their projects showed flaws in the system.\xa0</p><p>One even gets\xa0Environment Minister Catherine McKenna\u2019s view that there might be a need to\xa0\u201crebuild Canadians\u2019 trust in our environmental assessment processes\u201d and a \u201cneed to take into account the views and concerns of Canadians\u201d\xa0in the wake of the Stephen Harper Conservatives\u2019 approach.</p><p>But there\u2019s something really disturbing about the political immaturity in Trudeau\u2019s suggestion that he will not be a \u201ccheerleader\u201d for the pipeline industry industry like the last government was.</p><p>There are tens of thousands of people who have lost their jobs in the western oil sector \u2014\xa0many of them without unionized severance benefits and pensions.

{u'full_article': u"<p>FILE -- A dump truck works near the Syncrude oil sands extraction facility near the town of Fort McMurray, Alberta on Sunday June 1, 2014. The furore over a New Democrat candidate's remarks about leaving a lot of Alberta's oilsands in the ground is a reflection of how poorly the issue is understood, say energy experts.JASON FRANSON / THE CANADIAN PRESS</p><p>The verbal battles between Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre and western premiers and mayors are reruns of a bad movie. Let\u2019s change the channel and look at TransCanada\u2019s proposed Energy East pipeline in light of climate change. That was not on anyone\u2019s mind 35 years ago during tussles around the National Energy Program.</p><p>TransCanada\u2019s proposed Energy East pipeline is so capacious that it could single-handedly allow expansion of Alberta\u2019s oilsands by over 40 per cent. That\u2019s the same percentage rise as the sands emission cap that Alberta\u2019s new climate action plan permits.</p><p>The rise of oilsands emissions from 70 to 100 million tonnes a year will prevent Canada from meeting its laudable and ambitious targets at the Paris climate talks in December and Canada\u2019s 2009 commitment at the G8 meetings in L\u2019Aquila, Italy to lower carbon emissions by 80 per cent below Canada\u2019s 1990 level of 600 million tonnes by 2050. That means a drop to 120 million tonnes of greenhouse gases.</p><p>To hit Canada\u2019s promises, oilsands output and emissions must be capped at 70 million tonnes and then phased out. We can\u2019t get to a low carbon future unless we do so.</p><p>U.S. President Barack Obama killed the Keystone XL oil pipeline after a 1,000 protesters were arrested outside the White House; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau effectively killed the Northern Gateway line by banning oil tankers in the treacherous waters off B.C.\u2019s northern coast after many British Columbians declared it will not proceed; and B.C. Premier Christy Clark\u2019s government opposed the expansion of Kinder Morgan\u2019s existing oil pipeline to the Vancouver area after opposition grew strong.</p><p>Opposition to Energy East is growing as strong.</p><p>Energy East is the final sands oil exporting line left standing. That\u2019s why oil companies and western politicians are so desperate to get it approved. But it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right thing to do.</p><p>Enbridge\u2019s Line 9 started bringing western Canadian oil and North Dakota shale oil to Quebec\u2019s two refineries in December. Those refineries are not likely to take on additional oil from the Energy East line. All or most would flow onto Irving Oil\u2019s refinery in Saint John, N.B.</p><p>However Mark Sherman, plant manager at the Irving refinery has stated that Energy East would send \u201cway more than we would ever use at this refinery, so the bulk of it would all be exported.\u201d</p><p>Alberta\u2019s oilsands are the fastest growing source of Canada\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution.</p><p>Oilsands output will grow substantially only if it has an outlet to a coast.</p><p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pegs oilsands emissions much higher than conventional oil. Alberta\u2019s oilsands can\u2019t be greened.</p><p>It\u2019s the production of oil and natural gas, not in their use in transportation in Canada (cars and trucks), that is this country\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gases.</p><p>Canada has just enough conventional, non-fracked, non-sands oil to supply all Canadians as we steadily lower consumption. It would also give every Canadian energy security. But there\u2019s not enough such oil to continue exports.</p><p>Our country\u2019s emissions will plummet when Canada phases them out.</p><p>Why run a pipeline 4,600 kilometres to New Brunswick anyway when Newfoundland has enough conventional oil to supply all east coasters? Most live on or near a coast. Why pipe it when it can be shipped?</p><p>That would avoid incursions on First Nations lands. Oil tankers could be phased out as East Coasters\u2019 oil use falls, whereas a pipeline would need three decades of shipping oilsands oil at full volume to amortize its building costs.</p><p>Trudeau and the premiers are scheduled to meet by March 11 to fashion a plan to transition Canada to a low-carbon future. They should nix Energy East.</p><p>Gordon Laxer is author of After the Sands. Energy and Ecological Security for Canadians and is founding director of Parkland Institute at the University of Alberta.

{u'full_article': u'<p>"There\'s not a country in the world," a shaggy-haired Justin Trudeau told a curious Calgary audience in early October 2012, "that would find 170 billion barrels of oil under the ground and leave them there."</p>&#13;<p>Trudeau was launching the campaign that would make him Liberal leader. To be taken seriously, the young Quebecer needed to cast himself as an economic pragmatist. This required the careful creation of some ideological distance between himself and his dad, whose gifts, it is fair to say, lay outside economics. The symbol of choice would be Alberta oil.</p>&#13;<p>But here\'s the thing about pulling those 170 billion barrels from the ground: It follows that the resulting carbon emissions don\'t vary whether the oil goes to market through a pipeline, in a rail car or behind a tractor trailer. The oil gets burned. From a climate-change standpoint, it\'s a zero-sum game.</p>&#13;<p>So, what does it mean that Trudeau\'s government is now adding new layers of environmental and political scrutiny to the pipeline approvals process? And what does the rhetoric signify? In a nutshell, it means the Grits no longer consider Thomas Mulcair and his New Democrats to be a threat. Nor are they much concerned about Ontario conservatives, or Conservatives.</p>&#13;<p>In late 2012, Trudeau and his team faced two strategic problems, and one big opportunity.</p>&#13;<p>Problem 1 was a hard-charging Stephen Harper, pre-Mike Duffy Senate scandal. Problem 2 was the new NDP leader, Mulcair, who had won the leadership of his party on the promise of moving it to the centre.</p>&#13;<p>Mulcair also yielded the opportunity: In an apparent bid to court sentiment in Ontario\'s manufacturing heartland, he began talking up "Dutch disease," the ostensible hardship caused by high oil prices (we should wish for such hardship, now) and attacking TransCanada\'s Keystone XL plan to build a pipeline linking Alberta with the Texas Gulf Coast.</p>&#13;<p>Trudeau backed Keystone unequivocally. In doing so he ticked off several important strategic boxes at a stroke. He made himself appear economically more serious than Mulcair. He got attention in Alberta. He reassured Ontario swing voters, always seeking a leader who can mind the store. And he cast himself as a pro-business Liberal, someone to whom a weary Harper voter might switch in a pinch.</p>&#13;<p>It worked, from a Liberal standpoint.

{u'full_article': u"<p>An aerial view of the 400 ton trucks and 100 ton electric rope shovels used at Suncor's Millennium Mine oilsands operation north of Fort McMurray.Ryan Jackson / Edmonton Journal</p><p>Verbal battles between Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre and western premiers and mayors are reruns of a bad old movie.</p><p>Let\u2019s change the channel and look at TransCanada\u2019s proposed Energy East pipeline in light of climate change. That was not on anyone\u2019s mind 35 years ago during tussles around the national energy program.</p><p>TransCanada\u2019s proposed Energy East pipeline is so capacious that it could single-handedly allow expansion of Alberta\u2019s sands by\xa0more than\xa040 per cent. That\u2019s the same percentage rise as the sands emission cap that Alberta\u2019s new climate action plan permits.</p><p>The rise of sands emissions from 70 million to 100 million tonnes a year will prevent Canada from meeting its laudable and ambitious targets at the Paris climate talks in December and Canada\u2019s 2009 commitment at the G8 meetings in L\u2019Aquila, Italy, to lower carbon emissions by 80\xa0per cent\xa0below Canada\u2019s 1990 level of 600 million tonnes by 2050. That means a drop to 120 million tonnes of greenhouse gases.</p><p>To hit Canada\u2019s promises, sands output and emissions must be capped at 70 million tonnes,\xa0then phased out. We can\u2019t get to a low carbon future unless we do so.</p><p>Some in the oilpatch wonder why pipelines are approved easily within the U.S, but not within Canada. The answer is simple. The four major oil pipelines under review in Canada are mainly sands oil exporting lines.</p><p>U.S. President Barack Obama killed the Keystone XL oil pipeline after protests. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau effectively killed the Northern Gateway line by banning oil tankers from B.C.\u2019s northern coast after public concerns.\xa0B.C. Premier Christy Clark\u2019s government opposed the expansion of Kinder Morgan\u2019s existing oil pipeline to the Vancouver area after resistance grew.</p><p>Opposition to Energy East is growing as strong.</p><p>Energy East is the final sands oil exporting line left standing. That\u2019s why Big Oil and western politicians are so desperate to get it approved. Desperation leads to flared tempers. But it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right thing to do.</p><p>Enbridge\u2019s Line 9 started bringing western Canadian oil and North Dakota shale oil to Quebec\u2019s two refineries in December. Those refineries will not take on additional oil from the Energy East line. All or most would flow to Irving Oil\u2019s refinery in Saint John, N.B.</p><p>However, Mark Sherman, plant manager at the Irving refinery has stated Energy East would send \u201cway more than we would ever use at this refinery, so the bulk of it would all be exported\u201d.</p><p>Alberta\u2019s sands output, the fastest growing source of Canada\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution,\xa0will grow substantially only if it has an outlet to a coast.</p><p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pegs sands emissions much higher than conventional oil. Alberta\u2019s sands can\u2019t be greened.</p><p>It\u2019s the production of oil and natural gas, not in their use in transportation in Canada (cars and trucks), that is this country\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gases.</p><p>Canada has just enough conventional, non-fracked, non-sands oil to supply all Canadians as we steadily lower consumption. It would also give every Canadian energy security. But there\u2019s not enough such oil to continue exports.</p><p>Why run a pipeline 4,600 kilometres to New Brunswick anyway when Newfoundland has enough conventional oil to supply the East? Most live on or near a coast. Why pipe it when it can be shipped?</p><p>That would avoid incursions on First Nations lands. Oil tankers could be phased out as East Coast use falls, whereas a pipeline would need three decades of shipping sands oil at full volume to amortize its building costs.\xa0</p><p>Prime Minister Trudeau and the premiers are scheduled to meet by March 11 to fashion a plan to transition Canada to a low-carbon future. They should nix Energy East.</p><p>Gordon Laxer is author of\xa0After the Sands.

{u'full_article': u'<p>No other major oil exporting nation would wilfully impose so many obstacles on the development of the struggling energy industry, a vital source of wealth in this country for the past several decades.DARRYL DYCK / THE CANADIAN PRESS</p><p>Does Canada have a death wish? That\u2019s how\xa0a veteran investment adviser I know characterizes this country\u2019s apparent\xa0desire to cripple\xa0its own energy industry in\xa0some weirdly misguided ideological campaign\xa0to save the planet.</p><p>The Trudeau government\u2019s latest move \u2014 to\xa0add some ill-defined climate test to the\xa0lengthy,\xa0years-long\xa0regulatory review process that already exists for new oil pipelines \u2014 makes him apoplectic. No wonder.</p><p>No other major oil exporting nation would\xa0wilfully impose so many obstacles\xa0on the development of the struggling\xa0energy industry, a vital source of wealth in this country for the past several decades.</p><p>Certainly not the U.S., despite President Barack Obama\u2019s green rhetoric. Definitely not Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, which is shipping more oil than ever to China.\xa0Not Saudi Arabia, Iraq, or any of the other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\xa0Not Alberta competitors\xa0such\xa0Mexico or Venezuela.\xa0Not Brazil, Australia or Indonesia. No one.\xa0</p><p>Canada alone, the global boy scout, makes the regulatory hurdles for new oil export pipelines all but impossible to satisfy.\xa0And for what? To\xa0pacify\xa0Canada\u2019s\xa0noisy environmental lobby, which will never be appeased? To keep aboriginal activists happy, despite the sky-high unemployment levels on most reserves?</p><p>And what is the pipeline opponents\u2019 overall objective,\xa0exactly? To shut in the oilsands and save the world from frying? Please, spare me the nonsensical rhetoric. The numbers don\u2019t add up.</p><p>The oilsands\xa0contribute less than\xa0two-tenth of one per cent of global carbon emissions. That\u2019s\xa00.002 per cent cent.\xa0How\xa0small\xa0is that? On\xa0a $75 tank of gasoline, 0.002 per cent equates to 15 cents. It\u2019s a\xa0rounding error.</p><p>Yet the Liberal government\xa0and much of the left-leaning Toronto-based media\xa0have convinced gullible Canadians that the very future of sacred\xa0Gaia\xa0hinges on keeping Alberta\u2019s bitumen in the ground. Alberta\u2019s climate change plan hasn\u2019t altered their radical views one iota.</p><p>The\xa0eco warriors\u2019\xa0fallback argument \u2014 that bitumen has a higher carbon footprint than conventional oil \u2014 is equally\xa0hyperbolic. It\u2019s like counting how many angels can do a jig on the head of a pin.\xa0In global terms, it\u2019s the square root of zilch.</p><p>On a well-to-wheels basis (i.e., between the wellhead and the gas tank), the difference is under 10\xa0per cent. It\xa0continues to shrink\xa0as oilsands producers become\xa0more efficient. What\u2019s more, much of the oil the U.S. imports from producers in Mexico, Venezuela or elsewhere carries\xa0virtually the same carbon footprint.</p><p>Yet while Obama slammed the door shut on TransCanada\u2019s Keystone XL pipeline, he hasn\u2019t said a word about imposing a\xa0carbon tax on Mexican or Iraqi\xa0imports. Nor does he seem\xa0averse to all the pipeline building going on under his watch in the U.S.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve\xa0been building tons of pipelines in the U.S. It\xa0seems to have been a pretty friendly environment in terms of building oil pipelines in our country,\u201d says Jeff Mower, New York-based\xa0director of Americas oil news for Platts, an\xa0energy industry news and research organization.</p><p>\u201cMaybe\xa0not everywhere, but definitely going south\xa0from Cushing (a major oil storage hub in Oklahoma) there\u2019s been a lot of pipeline build-out. And now, with the lifting of the crude oil export restrictions, I imagine there is going to be more built,\u201d he adds. That includes the new Bakken oil pipeline to connect\xa0North Dakota\u2019s oilfields with refineries in Illinois.</p><p>If the CBC, Toronto Star and other left-leaning\xa0national media spent half as much time educating\xa0people\xa0on facts like these,\xa0rather than endlessly rehashing\xa0the latest anti-oil propaganda\xa0from Greenpeace, Neil Young, Bill McKibben or Leonardo (what\u2019s a chinook?) DiCaprio, perhaps Canadians\xa0could have an adult conversation about emissions or\xa0the need for new energy infrastructure. Right now, it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>Imagine if Ottawa imposed its\xa0new climate test on\xa0British Columbia\u2019s $5-billion coal export industry which conveniently bypasses\xa0B.C.\u2019s carbon tax? What if it applied its climate test on any new auto plants, on Quebec\u2019s\xa0aerospace industry\xa0(hello, Bombardier), or all\xa0new airport infrastructure? Cue the outrage. Yet Alberta is regarded as fair game.</p><p>Oh well, not to worry. I\u2019m sure\xa0Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will gladly explain all when\xa0he visits Alberta Premier Rachel Notley on her home turf this week.\xa0</p><p>Meanwhile, another contact of mine, a former\xa0senior bureaucrat\xa0in the provincial\xa0government, has calculated\xa0how much money\xa0Alberta taxpayers and firms\xa0have shipped\xa0to Ottawa\xa0over the past 15 years, over and above what the feds have reinvested here.</p><p>The\xa0figures\xa0he came up with are truly staggering \u2014 totalling many times the current value of the $17.4 billion Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund. Want to know why Alberta isn\u2019t as rich as Norway? You can start right there.</p><p>While he\u2019s here, perhaps Trudeau\xa0could set aside some time to\xa0address that topic. I\u2019m sure Albertans would\xa0appreciate his insights.</p><p>glamphier@postmedia.com</p><p>\xa0</p><p>\xa0</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://edmontonjournal.com/feed/', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-liberals-new-climate-test-latest-hurdle-for-pipelines', u'author': u'Gary Lamphier, Edmonton Journal', u'original_article_url': u'http://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-liberals-new-climate-test-latest-hurdle-for-pipelines', u'scraped_on': 1454376767, u'published_date': u'Tue, 02 Feb 2016 01:18:52 +0000', u'title': u"Gary Lamphier: Liberals' new 'climate test' latest hurdle for pipelines", u'_id': ObjectId('56b0073f1d41c810b3135afb'), u'media_url': u'http://edmontonjournal.com/'}
{u'full_article': u'<p>Premier Rachel Notley releases the findings of the Alberta Royalty Review Advisory Panel in Calgary on Friday, Jan. 29, 2016. (Ted Rhodes/Postmedia)</p><p>As the policy drops continue, it becomes ever more obvious the NDP is imposing\xa0an all-embracing eco-industrial system\xa0unlike anything Alberta has ever seen.</p><p>This is nothing less than a revolution planned and directed from the legislature. For\xa0sheer scope and ambition, it far outstrips anything done by the surprising NDP demigod, the late PC premier Peter Lougheed.</p><p>The revolution spreads across climate change, carbon tax, pipelines, green incentives, energy royalties, personal taxes, debt accumulation and, as of Monday, direct incentives to petrochemical companies.</p><p>Premier Rachel Notley is determined to fashion a complex new \u201cprogressive\u201d economy that cannot be readily dismantled by some stray conservative government of the future.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a genuine industrial strategy,\u201d Mount Royal University political scientist Keith Brownsey said admiringly after the royalty review was released Friday, \u201cand it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p><p>Maybe most\xa0of Alberta will say that some day. If it works.</p><p>That is, if it rescues the province from failing competitiveness, from the domestic war on Canadian oil, from hyper-dependence on one\xa0resource, from\xa0smarter opponents in both foreign boardrooms and around eco-campfires at home; if it creates jobs and green pop-up companies, and revenues that pull the province out of fiscal quicksand.</p><p>It is fascinating to see how the NDP, which is supposed to be inexperienced and incompetent, has pushed this agenda along so quickly that even the opposition parties are forced to keep catching up. They were surprisingly muted Monday.</p><p>Some NDP moves are just opportunistic\xa0rebranding of things the PCs were doing as\xa0they neared the end of days. The petrochemical incentives announced Monday, for instance, have been discussed for three years.</p><p>The New Democrats simply grab these smaller bricks,\xa0cement them into their much larger policy wall, and take credit for originality.</p><p>They\u2019re highly skilled at massaging issues and shaping messages. Last Friday, for instance, they turned most talk about the royalty review away from royalty rates and toward capital costs.</p><p>Almost lost in all this \u2014 by design, perhaps \u2014 was the plain fact that rates will be adjusted for wells drilled in 2017 and beyond. There was no explanation of what those increases\xa0would be.</p><p>Ex-premier Ed Stelmach wouldn\u2019t have got away with that. But the NDP mostly\xa0did, perhaps because they\u2019ve induced a numb exhaustion with change.</p><p>Inevitably, elements of the policy web don\u2019t make sense. Is it logical, for instance, to impose a carbon tax that will raise the price of natural gas, and then effectively lower that price for a select few, using $500 million in royalty credits for producers who supply petrochemical plants?</p><p>The policy is already picking winners and losers, both by sector and by region.</p><p>They were dancing in the aisles\xa0of Edmonton\u2019s \u201cIndustrial Heartland\u201d Monday when the petrochemical incentives were announced.</p><p>New plants that use heavily subsidized methane and propane will create plastics, fertilizer and other materials for the world will likely locate there (although it\u2019s unclear why they couldn\u2019t be elsewhere too.)</p><p>It\u2019s hard to resist the notion\xa0that this bonanza northeast of Edmonton is partial payback for the looming phase-out of the coal industry, which is located largely west of Edmonton.</p><p>The NDP doesn\u2019t seem worried by the increasingly hostile mood among\xa0some labour leaders, like AFL president Gil McGowan, who charges that the royalty report wasn\u2019t \u201cprogressive\u201d and ignored union input.</p><p>This government is\xa0after the great mass of suddenly job-hungry Albertans.\xa0That means stalling some progressive projects and pushing others ahead. But the whole structure remains\xa0the most radical the province has ever seen.</p><p>In his first two years, Lougheed reviewed and raised oil and gas royalties, bought Pacific Western Airlines, and withheld shipping permits from TransCanada (imagine that!) on grounds that prices were too low.\xa0</p><p>Lougheed was widely condemned as a socialist. People wondered how they could have elected such an inept amateur. But he became a hero after the policies gelled and\xa0Alberta began to prosper.</p><p>Notley surely longs for that future. She might just get it \u2014 although, compared to her, Lougheed was an amateur in the change game.</p><p>Don Braid\u2019s column appears regularly in the Herald</p><p>dbraid@calgayherald.com\xa0</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://calgaryherald.com/feed/', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/braid-notleys-changes-add-up-to-an-alberta-revolution', u'author': u'Don Braid, Calgary Herald', u'original_article_url': u'http://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/braid-notleys-changes-add-up-to-an-alberta-revolution', u'scraped_on': 1454378646, u'published_date': u'Tue, 02 Feb 2016 01:58:05 +0000', u'title': u"Braid: Notley's changes add up to an Alberta revolution", u'_id': ObjectId('56b00e961d41c8110eaa7f10'), u'media_url': u'http://calgaryherald.com/'}

{u'full_article': u"<p>Premier Brad Wall's argument on Energy East and equalization isn't helpful.TROY FLEECE / Regina Leader-Post</p><p>From Quebec\u2019s enviro-nationalists to Alberta\u2019s old energy apologists, few are tackling the issue of TransCanada\u2019s contentious Energy East pipeline with any semblance of balance.\xa0Some are even exacerbating what has now become a minor national unity crisis.</p><p>When the autopsy of this messy debate is conducted, at least three men will be found responsible: Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, and the CBC\u2019s Rick Mercer. Consumed with their narrow interests, the politicians seem to have forgotten that Canada remains a federation, not a collection of fiefdoms, while the ranting comedian reduces Canada\u2019s complex equalization system to a series of transactions between East and West.</p><p>\u201cWe all need this thing,\u201d Mercer said, clever as always, but failing to demonstrate that we truly need this one particular oil pipeline as a magic bullet to rescue Canada\u2019s sluggish economy. Mercer\u2019s Quebecois counterpart, Jean-Rene \u201cInfoman\u201d Dufort, joined a chorus of parody videos pointing out that receiving equalization payments doesn\u2019t mean Quebec should embrace new pipelines while British Columbia and the United States reject them.</p><p>While asymmetrical federalism can have its drawbacks, Wall expressed on social media that he would seemingly prefer a form of ransom federalism, where an oil empowered western premier acts as if he has the authority to hang federal equalization dollars over the heads of Quebecers.</p><p>\u201cI trust Montreal-area mayors will politely return their share of $10-billion in equalization supported by west(ern provinces),\u201d Wall quipped, to which Parti Quebecois MNA Jean-Francois Lisee replied, \u201cI trust the West will refund the $10 billion of Quebec taxes spent on big oil tax breaks and grants over the years.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a childish debate for Wall to ignite, one that fails to consider the purpose of federal governments. He should know that pitting regions against each other fuels sovereigntist hysteria and is counterproductive for the 100,000 workers who lost their jobs last year as a result of the downturn in the energy sector.</p><p>\u201cSay thank you,\u201d Coderre then tweeted, waving those same federal dollars over the heads of Saskatchewanians while Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose warned that Coderre\u2019s rhetoric \u201cisn\u2019t in the spirit of national unity.\u201d (Neither was Wall\u2019s.)</p><p>The Rest of Canada\u2019s position is seen as paternalistic by some Quebec commentators. \u201cColonialist schemes\u201d are forcing Quebecers into a position of \u201cconstant submission,\u201d wrote sovereigntist thinker Mathieu Bock-Cote. Apparently eager to capitalize on western missteps, Quebecor colleague Josee LeGault even compared the Energy East spat to the failure of the Meech Lake constitutional reforms (wishful thinking)!</p><p>I trust Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has reminded his provincial and municipal counterparts that, on a handful of federal files like Energy East, it simply isn\u2019t the prerogative of regions to set the tone of the debate. There is no need for such firmly entrenched stances on either side when the National Energy Board and Quebec\u2019s Office of Environmental Public Hearings have yet to complete their work.</p><p>Communication on the issue has been so muddled that a source close to the industry mused that \u201cthe biggest question most journalists have is whether the\xa0pipelines will be underground or above ground.\u201d\xa0 Energy East would be underground, even under the St. Lawrence River, which presents fewer environmental risks than transport via an overloaded rail system. If journalists are confused about the Energy East plan, the public at large is surely disconnected from the debate, making polls on the issue largely irrelevant.</p><p>The pipeline is a private endeavour that is for TransCanada\u2019s, not Wall, to sell to Canadians. It may be seen as necessary, but it is not free of risk and certainly isn\u2019t an example of sustainable development.</p><p>While regional considerations should be just that, considerations, a final Energy East decision should be based on sound science resulting from rigorous consultation and evaluation \u2014 not what\u2019s best for Coderre\u2019s fiefdom or Wall\u2019s. Conservative panic over a struggling oil industry, however, has backfired and placed TransCanada in a more disadvantageous position as the prime minister, among his considerations, now must consider growing discontent among Quebec nationalists.</p><p> Dan Delmar is a Montreal public relations consultant, writer and broadcaster.</p>", u'rss_url': u'http://thestarphoenix.com/feed/', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://thestarphoenix.com/opinion/letters/0203-edit-delmar-view', u'author': u'Sarath Peiris, Saskatoon StarPhoenix', u'original_article_url': u'http://thestarphoenix.com/opinion/letters/0203-edit-delmar-view', u'scraped_on': 1454505526, u'published_date': u'Wed, 03 Feb 2016 12:52:24 +0000', u'title': u'Viewpoint: Wall ignites childish debate over Energy East', u'_id': ObjectId('56b1fe361d41c87573c7defb'), u'media_url': u'http://thestarphoenix.com/'}
{u'full_article': u'<p>MONTREAL -- The rejection by Montreal-area municipal leaders of TransCanada Corp.\'s proposed Energy East pipeline prompted a sharp political rebuke from some parts of Western Canada on Thursday.</p><p>The Montreal Metropolitan Community, which represents 82 municipalities and 3.9 million residents, said it opposes the project and will defend that position at Quebec environmental impact and National Energy Board hearings.</p><p>Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, the current president of the organization, said the decision was unanimous and that the environmental risks of a spill far outweigh any economic benefits for the region.</p><p>That position sparked anger in Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p><p>Deron Bilous, Alberta\'s minister of economic development and trade, said his province is now doing its share to combat climate change while facing tremendous challenges with the collapse of oil prices.</p><p>"We all look to the same resource revenues to create jobs and fund the social programs we all depend on," Bilous said. "The mayor of Montreal\'s statement today is therefore both ungenerous and short-sighted. Everyone loses if we destroy our resource economy."</p><p>Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall called it sad that leaders from Quebec would be so "parochial" about a project that would benefit all of Canada.</p><p>Wall said Quebec will receive about $10 billion in equalization payments this year.</p><p>"For the better part of the past decade the western Canadian energy sector and western Canadian taxpayers have supported a great portion of these transfer payments as well as the Canadian economy," he said in a statement.</p><p>"Is it too much to expect that these Quebec municipal leaders would respond to this reality with generous support for a pipeline that supports the very sector that has supported them?"</p><p>Coderre said the project is worth about $2 million a year in economic benefits to the Montreal area, while the cleanup of a major oil spill could cost between $1 billion and $10 billion.</p><p>Environmental consultations were held across the Montreal territory last September and October and Coderre said the majority of the 140 groups that submitted briefs were opposed to the project.</p><p>TransCanada maintains that pipelines are safer and more environmentally friendly than rail for transporting oil.</p><p>A TransCanada spokesman was hopeful the company could keep channels open with elected Montreal-area officials.</p><p>"We will continue to listen to other elected leaders in Quebec and stakeholders across the province as we take their concerns and input seriously," Jonathan Abecassis said in a statement.</p><p>The proposed pipeline would take Alberta crude as far east as an Irving Oil refinery in Saint John, N.B., and would be capable of carrying up to 1.1 million barrels a day from the West to the East.</p><p>The project would include existing TransCanada (TSX:TRP) pipeline as far east as Montreal, plus new pipeline to be constructed through Quebec.</p><p>Wildrose Leader Brian Jean said the Alberta NDP government\'s strategy around pipelines is failing and that it\'s time Premier Rachel Notley started standing up for the province against "unfair attacks."</p><p>"While Mr. Coderre dumps a billion litres of raw sewage directly into his waterways and benefits from billions in equalization payments, his opposition to the Energy East pipeline is nothing short of hypocritical," Jean said.</p><p>"Montreal buys millions of barrels of foreign oil from dictatorships, but it is rejecting oil from their friends in Confederation. It\'s disgraceful! This is a project that will benefit all of Canada and will improve our GDP by $55 billion. It\'s time that Rachel Notley realizes this and starts fighting for Alberta."</p><p>In December, TransCanada filed an amended application with the National Energy Board that included some 700 changes to deal specifically with environmental concerns. One month earlier, the company announced it wouldn\'t build an oil export terminal in Quebec.</p><p>The company estimates the cost of the pipeline will now come in $15.7 billion, up from the original $12 billion price tag. That amount doesn\'t count the existing pipeline assets that will be converted for use in Energy East.</p><p>Greenpeace applauded Coderre\'s announcement, saying it should send a signal to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to reject the project.</p><p>"Trudeau already said that pipelines projects must be accepted by the local communities before they get approved," said spokesman Patrick Bonin.</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/rss/ctv-news-montreal-1.822366', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/montreal-area-mayors-oppose-energy-east-pipeline-1.2746742', u'author': u'Sidhartha Banerjee and Lia Levesque', u'original_article_url': u'http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/montreal-area-mayors-oppose-energy-east-pipeline-1.2746742', u'scraped_on': 1454520775, u'published_date': u'Thu, 21 Jan 2016 14:11:00 -0500', u'title': u'Montreal-area mayors oppose Energy East pipeline', u'_id': ObjectId('56b239c81d41c87e50f91917'), u'media_url': u'http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/'}

Topp was Jack Layton\u2019s lead negotiator in the talks that led to the 2008 Liberal-NDP coalition accord.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">But while the prime minister can offer Notley some financial relief in the upcoming federal budget, the real test of their relationship will be the resolution of the pipeline file and the fate of Alberta\u2019s efforts to connect the oilsands to tidewater.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">It is by far the most contentious issue on the federal-provincial radar. Yet, this is one national discussion that is unlikely to be resolved between first ministers. To date, the lead players in the debate have mostly been municipal politicians.</p>Joanne Monaghan was the mayor of Kitimat, B.C., on whose watch a plebiscite was held on the Northern Gateway pipeline in 2014. As the end point for the pipeline bringing oil from Alberta, Kitimat would be home to a marine terminal where tankers would load up. Almost 60 per cent of her constituents voted no, driving another nail in the coffin of the moribund $6.5-billion Enbridge project.Derek Corrigan is the mayor of Burnaby, B.C. The Trans Mountain pipeline runs through the city and its corporate owner, Kinder Morgan, wants to triple its capacity. Corrigan is hardly the only Vancouver-area mayor to oppose the pipeline but he is one of the most vocal. Last May, he told a community meeting he was prepared to be arrested and see his political career come to an end to stop the project. He called last week\u2019s federal announcement of an expanded consultation process and an extended approval timeline a disappointment.<p class="text combinedtext parbase section">Marc Demers is the mayor of Laval, Quebec\u2019s third largest city, and one of 82 Montreal-area municipal leaders who came out against the Energy East pipeline. While most Canadians see Denis Coderre as the face of the region\u2019s opposition to TransCanada\u2019s current plans, Demers has been campaigning hard against the pipeline since early last fall.</p><p class="text combinedtext parbase section">Gilles Lehouillier is the major of L\xe9vis, across from Quebec City. He turned down TransCanada\u2019s plan to locate a terminal for the Energy East pipeline in his city and remains ambivalent about the project as whole.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">There are mayors in the pro-pipeline camp who are not from Saskatchewan and Alberta \u2014 the two provinces whose oil industry needs access to a coast \u2014 but their support tends to be more tentative than the opposition of some of their mayoral colleagues.</p><p class="text combinedtext parbase section">Quebec City\u2019s R\xe9gis Labeaume gave his support in principle to the Energy East pipeline last week. In the same breath though, he said TransCanada had proven inept at addressing the environmental concerns arising from the project.</p><p class="text combinedtext parbase section">Mel Norton, the mayor of Saint John, N.B., where some of the oil delivered by the pipeline would be refined, also supports Energy East but his municipal council wants more definitive answers from TransCanada as to its benefits for the region.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">Canada has hit upon defining issues that have pitted regions against region in the past.

But none of those discussions engaged Canada\u2019s municipal politicians in the way that this one does.</p><p itemprop="articleBody">No mayor holds a veto over a pipeline but it will be hard to secure a social licence for any project absent more support from the political leaders who are closest to the day-to-day life of so many voters.</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.thestar.com/feeds.articles.news.canada.rss', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/02/04/support-from-mayors-essential-for-any-pipeline-project-hbert.html', u'author': u'Chantal H\xe9bert - National Affairs', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/02/04/support-from-mayors-essential-for-any-pipeline-project-hbert.html', u'scraped_on': 1454581363, u'published_date': u'Thu, 4 Feb 2016 05:00:00 EST', u'title': u'Support from mayors essential for any pipeline project: H\xe9bert', u'_id': ObjectId('56b326751d41c820b569ef33'), u'media_url': u'http://www.thestar.com/'}
{u'full_article': u'<p>IF the struggle by TransCanada Corp. to try to finesse its Energy East pipeline proposal across most of Canada seems difficult, it pales in comparison with a much larger question: Are we serious about climate change? If we are, we cannot extract any more than 10 per cent of the oil underground in Alberta. If we aren\u2019t serious about working to combat increasingly weird and dangerous weather caused by greenhouse gases, we\u2019ll allow TransCanada and other pipeline builders to carry on. Those are some pretty stark questions considering the importance of the energy sector to Canada\u2019s economy.</p><p>TransCanada was content to work the back channels in its otherwise public bid to ship oil from Alberta through an old natural gas pipeline that crosses sensitive areas of Northwestern Ontario, to refineries and for export in Atlantic Canada.</p><p>Ontario and Quebec, where most of the plan resides, are crucial to Trans-Canada\u2019s bid. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne has sided with Alberta\u2019s Rachel Notley on the company\u2019s side. Their view: Let\u2019s worry about climate change later; for now, under certain safety and environmental conditions, let\u2019s get this product to those who want to buy it. The fact that, as letter writer Peter Lang reminds us today, the Ontario Energy Board has said conclusively there are more risks than benefits to the project seems to have evaded Wynne.</p><p>Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard has been noncommittal, but 82 mayors, led by Montreal\u2019s Denis Coderre, may have forced his hand. The mayors want no part of a plan that continues to raise questions and concerns the more it is examined.</p><p>So, TransCanada has tossed a hail Mary pass. It announced Wednesday a deal with a Swiss manufacturer to build 22 electrical pumping stations in the Montreal region. This transparent ruse to win over 82 mayors with the promise of 120 mostly temporary jobs is offensive. And why not have a Canadian company build the stations? (TransCanada will be in Thunder Bay next week to make \u201ca major funding announcement\u201d in support of the 211 telephone assistance line.)</p><p>But whether Energy East, and its new president\u2019s I\u2019m-just-a-regular guy approach in announcing the Quebec initiative, succeed, the larger questions still loom. Canada has taken a lead in global climate change efforts in proposing targets lower than those officially adopted. Can we hope to reach any target if we carry on extracting oil and burning it? And how do we get there?</p><p>This is hardly something that can be changed overnight. Our economy, our world, is too dependent on oil to turn off the taps tomorrow. But by committing to new pipelines today, Canada will be ensuring that the will to embrace new options and technologies is delayed. Most climate scientists warn that this is a recipe for more and more widespread weather disaster.</p>', u'rss_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/search/?c%5B%5D=opinion%2Feditorials%2A&d=&d1=&d2=&f=rss&l=25&q=&s=start_time&sd=desc&t=article', u'language': u'en', u'in_drupal': False, u'redirected_article_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/opinion/editorials/pipelines-and-beyond/article_742b9744-cac3-11e5-a3ac-9f5a17bf5e35.html', u'author': u'None', u'original_article_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/opinion/editorials/pipelines-and-beyond/article_742b9744-cac3-11e5-a3ac-9f5a17bf5e35.html', u'scraped_on': 1454583885, u'published_date': u'Thu, 04 Feb 2016 06:00:00 -0500', u'title': u'Pipelines and beyond', u'_id': ObjectId('56b3304e1d41c8224e2fcc24'), u'media_url': u'http://www.chroniclejournal.com/'}

Demers stressed the city had its engineers analyse risks, and considered Canada\u2019s pledge at this year\u2019s Paris conference climate to reduce carbon emissions.</p>&#13;<p>\u201cWe met with the people from TransCanada \u2026 and the answers they gave us didn\u2019t assure us.\u201d</p>&#13;<p>Demers also bristled at suggestions Quebec should be less critical because it receives the lion\u2019s share of federal transfer payments. In the next financial year, Quebec is to receive $2,571 per person in tax transfers, versus $1,366 for each Albertan.</p>&#13;<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that people in Canada lose their right of speech because they get money from the federal government. I mean, Quebec has been contributing quite a lot to the Canadian economy in the past 10, 15, 100 years,\u201d Demers said.</p>&#13;<p>But Quebec City Mayor R\xe9gis Labeaume said he feared such divisions could jeopardize the beleaguered Quebec plane-maker Bombardier\u2019s request for a federal bailout.</p>&#13;<p>\u201cI read the papers in the west, and I feel just waiting to see what the federal government will decide about Bombardier. I\u2019m kind of worried.\u201d</p>&#13;<p>After a 2013 oil-train derailment killed 47 Quebecers, Labeaume said he supports \u201cmuch safer\u201d pipelines, but not the Energy East project because of the lack of consultation.</p>&#13;<p>\u201cIf we didn\u2019t learn from Lac-M\xe9gantic, I don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to learn,\u201d he told reporters in French, before blasting TransCanada. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re arrogant or incompetent, but they don\u2019t know how to work. It\u2019s kind of stupid.\u201d</p>&#13;<p>Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, who\u2019s been among the most outspoken against pipeline projects, was not present for Nenshi\u2019s speech.</p>&#13;<p>During his speech, Nenshi noted the U.S. ambassador to Canada was in the room, and said he believed the Keystone XL rejection was about competition, not environmental concerns.</p>&#13;<p>\u201cOur biggest customer, our only customer, is now our biggest competitor. We must find access to other markets,\u201d said Nenshi, who touted the need for safe electricity in developing countries.</p>&#13;<p>\u201cIt is our opportunity
